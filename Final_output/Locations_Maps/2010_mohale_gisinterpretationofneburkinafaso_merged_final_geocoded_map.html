This study focused on the identification of various lithological units using Landsat images with the aim of  using  them  as  part  of  a  dataset for  mineral  (gold and  other  mineral commodities)  potential targeting  in  Burkina  Faso,  mapping  of  geological  structures  and  also  land  use/cover  data  sets. This  was  completed  using  six  Landsat  images,  radiometric  and  magnetic  data. The  images  will  be  georeferenced  using  geographic  coordination  systems  or  projections. Based  on  the  spectral  capabilities  of  Landsat  7  image  data, the RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) band combination was prepared for discrimination of geological  features  (lithology,  structure  and  contacts). Although  the  spectral  capabilities  of  Landsat  data  do  not  provide new information on lithology, they are useful for extracting geological features that might have  not been defined by field studies and aerial photography or maps in the area. || CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION  1.1 Preamble  Most geological maps of Burkina Faso are outdated and due to high cost of aerial photography the maps  have not been updated. There is massive investment in exploration in NE Burkina Faso and there are few  geological maps that assist in targeting, with the latest being completed by Castaing in 2003. Therefore a  GIS  interpretation  was  undertaken  to  create  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  for  the  area. GIS  interpretation has become the most important modern tool for geological interpretation and a fundamental  approach in grassroots exploration for the delineation of resource potential. It involves the breaking up of  complex  data  planes  into  simpler  and  more  interpretable  forms  related  to  geological  features. Remote  sensing analysis from GIS is used to extract drainage and topographic patterns, curvilinear features and  stands of lithologically related vegetation (Drury, 1987). || Figure  4.3: The  Boromo–Goren  Greenstone  Belt  (BGGB)  of  Burkina  Faso,  together  with the  Bouroum  and Yalogo greenstone belts Hein et al.

Further investigations on lithologies and structures completed by  Hein et al. 2004 at Sanmatenga  district  indicate  that  the  deposition  of  the  volcanic,  metasedimentary  and  turbidic  rocks  in  the  Gorem  segment  of  the  BGGB  is  in  three  conformable  successions:  a  lower  volcano-  sedimentary  succession,  mafic-intermediate  volcanic  succession,  and an  upper  volcano-sedimentary  succession. The  successions  indicate  interplay  of  marine-deltaic  sedimentary  processes  and  volcanic  activity. The  deposition  was  interpreted to have occurred within a marginal marine setting adjacent to an emergent volcanic centre or  island arc setting (Hein et al., 2004). The conformable nature (angular unconformity) of the successions:  the 1) Lower Birimian and 2) Upper Birimian does not provide any case of separation into two formations  in the Sanmatenga district described from previous studies by Attoh (1982) and Feybesse et al., (1990).<br><b>Geocode:</b> посёлок Горем, Korotchaevo, Novy Urengoy, городской округ Новый Уренгой, Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Ural Federal District, Russia<br><b>Pages:</b> 17<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

This  study  showed  the  important use of colour composite images constructed from the LANDSAT 7 bands combined with  the magnetic and radiometric data and for geological mapping improves mapping. 48 || 2.2 Structures  In NE Burkina Faso there are four greenstone belts, of which three have been studied, namely, the  Goren  and  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone belts (Fig. 2.1)  which have  been  studied  by  Hein  et  al. (2004)  Hein  et  al. (2010)  and  Tshibubudze  et  al. (2009)  and  the  Yalogo  greenstone  belt  which  has  not  been  studied to date.

In  this  study,  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  of  NE  Burkina Faso was created using Landsat 7 imagery combined with radiometric and magnetic data. Four  different  false  color  composite  images  of  Landsat  data  (FCC  731,742,753  and  432)  RGB  images  were  generated and evaluated for lithological mapping and human geography studies. A false color composite  image of Landsat data 731 (RGB) was generated and used for production of the strato-tectonic-magmatic  map for the study area. Analysis of geological structures such as lineaments, shear zone, dykes, plutons  and lithological discrimination as well as geographic features was carried out using IDRISI Kilimanjaro  software and CorelDraw X3 ® software packages. Throughout  this  study  Landsat  data  731(RGB)  was  used  for  extraction  process. || CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION  1.1 Preamble  Most geological maps of Burkina Faso are outdated and due to high cost of aerial photography the maps  have not been updated. There is massive investment in exploration in NE Burkina Faso and there are few  geological maps that assist in targeting, with the latest being completed by Castaing in 2003. Therefore a  GIS  interpretation  was  undertaken  to  create  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  for  the  area. GIS  interpretation has become the most important modern tool for geological interpretation and a fundamental  approach in grassroots exploration for the delineation of resource potential. It involves the breaking up of  complex  data  planes  into  simpler  and  more  interpretable  forms  related  to  geological  features. Remote  sensing analysis from GIS is used to extract drainage and topographic patterns, curvilinear features and  stands of lithologically related vegetation (Drury, 1987). || Figure  3.2:  Aeromagnetic  data  A,  B,  C  with  total  magnetic  intensity  reduced  to  the  pole  1st  vertical  derivative. D-represents overlay of the three magnetic data (A, B and C). 3.1.4 Radiometric data  Total K-Th-U RGB data for NE Burkina Faso was used. Due to the image being cut off only few parts of  the image making the study area will be used. There are two images making the radiometric data (figure  4) and using CorelDraw X3 ® Software the two image in figure 4 A and C were inverted. 27 || The  Birimian  Bouroum-Yalogo  greenstone  belt  is  a  Y-shaped  terrane  located  between  large  Eburnean  granitoid  batholiths  200  km  northeast  of  Ouagadougou  (Ducellier  1963). It  consists  of:  (1)  metagranites,  metagabbro-diorites  and  metaquartzite  of  the  Bamga  series  (Hottin  and  Ouedraogo  1976;  Sawadogo 1983; Zonou, 1987) interpreted as early Birimian and dated at 2. 18 Ga (Boher et al. 1992); (2)  overlying  mafic  lava  flows  and  pillow  lavas  (Zonou  et  al.,1985)  with  associated  pyroclastites,  volcaniclastic rocks and immature sediments  mainly at lower levels and calc-alkaline andesite, dacite and  lamprophyre  at  upper  levels,  all  affected  by  a  greenschist-facies  metamorphism;  and  (3)  basic  to  intermediate plutons later emplaced. Markoye Shear zone  In  the  NE  Burkina  Faso  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Domain  of  the  West  African  Craton  is  crosscut by the NE-trending Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ) which is a first crustal scale structure. The MSZ  marks  the  western  boundary  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  Greenstone  Belt  which  extends  into  the  Niger  17 || The  map  by  Hottin  &  Ouedraogo  (1992)  doesn’t show  sand  dunes that cover most of the NE Burkina Faso. The new map (Fig. 5.2) has more details but more ground  truth  in the form  of  mapping  needs  to  be  done to  confirm  some  of  the  features  that are  not  covered  in  literature or haven’t been mapped. 45 || The last FCC  image was used for the location of outcrops.

Further investigations on lithologies and structures completed by  Hein et al. 2004 at Sanmatenga  district  indicate  that  the  deposition  of  the  volcanic,  metasedimentary  and  turbidic  rocks  in  the  Gorem  segment  of  the  BGGB  is  in  three  conformable  successions:  a  lower  volcano-  sedimentary  succession,  mafic-intermediate  volcanic  succession,  and an  upper  volcano-sedimentary  succession. The  successions  indicate  interplay  of  marine-deltaic  sedimentary  processes  and  volcanic  activity. The  deposition  was  interpreted to have occurred within a marginal marine setting adjacent to an emergent volcanic centre or  island arc setting (Hein et al., 2004). The conformable nature (angular unconformity) of the successions:  the 1) Lower Birimian and 2) Upper Birimian does not provide any case of separation into two formations  in the Sanmatenga district described from previous studies by Attoh (1982) and Feybesse et al., (1990).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sanmatenga, Central-North, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 17<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower  Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in  origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated  black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et  al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists  of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al.,  1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian  sequences  were  metamorphosed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  and  were  intruded  by  numerous  calc- alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are  collectively  termed  the  Eburnean  granitoids  (Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Naba  et  al.,  2004;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 15<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
