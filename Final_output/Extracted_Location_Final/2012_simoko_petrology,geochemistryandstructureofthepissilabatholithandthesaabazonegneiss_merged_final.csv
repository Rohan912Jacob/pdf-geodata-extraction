predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation 
event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism. || The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  exhibit  some  similarities  to  granitoid-gneissic

Samples from the Pissila batholith and the Saaba Zone gneiss were collected during field 
work  in  January  2012. Mapping  of  the  study  area  and  sample  collection  was  conducted  by 
Profs. Kerstin  Saalmann  and  Kim  Ncube-Hein. The  locations  of  each  station  point  were 
recorded  using  GPS  co-ordinates. The  World  Geodetic  System  (WGS  84)  and  Universal

7.1. Comparison between the gneiss and granodiorite 
The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  gneiss  are  petrologically  and  geochemically 
different from each other. The granodiorite exhibit a composition that is more mafic relative 
to the gneiss and migmatite. This is apparent in the thin section where hornblende and biotite 
are  dominant  in  the  granodiorite  relative  to  the  gneiss  and  migmatite. In  general,  the 
granodiorite  exhibit  higher  oxide  content  relative  to  the  gneiss  and  migmatite,  with  an 
exception to SiO2 and K2O. || 7.5. Comparison other regions in the craton similar to the study area

geochemically  similar  to  gneissic  terranes  in  the  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids  in  the
