young Wabo-Tampelse Event. The Tangaean Event and Eburnean Orogeny were associated 
with emplacement of TTG-suite plutons and dykes (Feybesse et al., 2006; Tshibubudze et al., 
2009; Hein 2010). The tectonic events resulted in the formation of greenstone belts separated 
by  the  granitoids  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002). The  Eburnean  Orogeny  resulted  in  regional 
metamorphism of the Birimian Supergroup to greenschist facies and contact metamorphism 
from pluton emplacement to low - medium amphibolite facies (Pons et al., 1995; Debat et al., 
2003). 2.2 Local geology

the  surrounding  area  (Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  submitted). The  most  likely  source  of

had  to  be  concentrated  and  localised. The  rapid  increase  of  temperature  in  pre-existing  hot 
conditions could have induced partial melting and dehydration of the rock. Migmatites from 
Saint-Malo, France, with a very similar mineral assemblage of muscovite-plagioclase-quartz 
leucosome and biotite-rich melanosome, are interpreted to have formed by the breakdown of 
muscovite (Sawyer, 2008). Although the Saint-Malo migmatites have been proposed to have 
formed  in  upper  amphibolite  facies,  the  presence  of  muscovite  in  the  metamorphosed  rock 
which formed the migmatite in KEMB would have been a source for more hydrous fluid. 46",llm,PLACE,49.742803,9.6275081,"Kembach, Wertheim, Main-Tauber-Kreis, Baden-Württemberg, 97277, Germany",APPROXIMATE,

In order to  gain  an understanding of the field  area, a mosaic was constructed using Google 
Earth® images of the Kel Enguef metamorphic belt before entering the field. This was used 
to  locate  the  field  area  with  respect  to  the  surrounding  topography  which  included  the 
location and orientation of rivers and ridges, as well as roads and villages. These were used 
for orientation in the field. Reconnaissance of the terrain and geology was carried out  in the field area before mapping 
commenced. This assisted in planning field mapping and the location of suitable drop-off and 
pick-up points and access within the field area. || 5. Petrography 
The petrographic study included 16 thin section samples of the Kel Enguef metamorphic belt. These  were  chosen  as  representative  samples  of  the  stratigraphy. The  focus  of  the 
petrographic study was on the textural features and mineral assemblages in order to establish 
the original rock types and the conditions which lead to metamorphism of the metamorphic 
samples. The study splits the samples into the various facies. Intrusive samples focus on the 
mineralogy. || Abstract 
The  Kel  Enguef  metamorphic  belt  is  host  to  metamorphosed  clastic  and  chemical 
sedimentary  rocks  that  are  intruded  by  gabbro  dykes  and  a  diorite  pluton. The 
metamorphosed  clastic  and  sedimentary  rocks  were  deposited  in  a  deltaic  setting  into  a 
shallow  marine  environment. The  sequences  comprise  fine-  to  coarse-grained  sedimentary 
rocks  that  exhibit  an  overall  upward  coarsening  stratigraphy. The  metamorphism  and 
deformation of the sequences is interpreted to have occurred mainly as a result of burial. Both 
greenschist and amphibolite grade metamorphism have been recognised. Gradation between 
these two facies is not observed. || STUDY AREA

metamorphism of the Birimian Supergroup to greenschist facies and contact metamorphism
