The West African craton (WAC) is ~ 4.5 million km2 and comprises two shields, the Reguibat Rise in 
the north and the Leo-Man Rise to the south (Milési et al., 1992; Villeneuve and Cornée, 1994; Attoh 
and Ekwueme, 1997; Potrel et al., 1998). The Taoudeni basin, situated in the central part of the craton, 
separates the two shields and is Neo-Proterozoic to Devonian in age (Dioh et al., 2006). The Leo-Man 
Rise  in  the  south  comprises  two  domains:  the  Archaean  Kenéma-Man  domain  and  the 
Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain. The  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  is  host  to  Birimian  sequences,

respectively (Kerr(b), 2004). The  dominant  stratigraphic  sequences  that  have  been  identified  in  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone 
belt are a volcaniclastic greywacke sequence and an interbedded conglomerate-greywacke-siltstone-

emplacement  of  igneous  bodies  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). The  environment  of  deposition  is 
interpreted to be a shallow marine continental shelf (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The  supracrustal  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  have  experienced  two  deformation 
events  that  resulted  in  the  formation  of  shears,  folds,  mylonite  zones  and  regional  metamorphism;

phases of gold mineralisation in the OGGB. The D1 is characterised by the metasomatic alteration of 
the wall rocks to form quartz vein hosted arsenopyrite-pyrite gold mineralisation and subsequent to 
׳
this  was  the  development of  vein-stockwork  mineralisation of  D2. The  V1  and V1
  observed in the 
Essakane deposit are interpreted to be mineralised during D1, with V2 mineralised during D2. The V2 
(stockwork veins) are typical of thermal-aureole vein assemblages noted by Wall (1991). The plutons 
intruding the OGGB are syn- to post Eburnean (Leube et al., 1990; Naba et al., 2004; Tshibubudze et

5.1 Preamble 
Fifteen polished thin sections were analysed for this project, with five thin sections from each deposit. The  petrography  section  aims  to  realise  the  main  aims  and  objectives  of  the  project. In  the  thin 
sections the rock types, mineralogy of the rocks, alteration types and microstructures were identified 
to determine a paragenetic sequence for the gold occurring in the Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt. The dominant sulphides included arsenopyrite and pyrite, with minor sphalerite, hematite, magnetite, 
chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. 5.2 Essakane 
The Essakane deposit is hosted in an inclined, asymmetrical NW-NNW trending anticline. The rock 
types that were identified in the thin sections are sandstone, siltstone, shale and volcaniclastics (Fig

pyrite  occurred  in  the  form  of  anhedral  masses  as  minor  product  of  the  reaction  of  feldspars  to 
produce sericite (Robb, 2007). Subsequent to sericitisation, silicification appears through the addition 
of quartz in the wallrock. Quartz-carbonate veins are interpreted to be the result of silicification and 
carbonatisation of the sequences. These veins crosscut the lithology and they follow open-space fill 
morphology with the quartz rimming the outside of the veins and the ankerite developing towards the 
centre of the veins. Calcite is the product of later carbonatisation and is extensive in the wallrock of

The  gold-hosting  sedimentary  sequences  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  underwent  four 
events to give rise to the gold mineralisation. The alteration that resulted during the metamorphism of 
the  rocks  is  linked  to  the  gold  mineralisation. Subsequent  to  deposition  of  sediments,  regional 
metamorphism during the Eburnean orogeny gave rise to greenschist facies metamorphic assemblages 
and  two  deformation  phases. The  first  deformation  phase  resulted  in  development  of  NW-NNW 
trending  folds  (F1),  NW-NNW  trending  foliation  (S1)  and  extensional-conjugate  vein  sets  (V1), 
interpreted  as  Tangaean  (D1)  structures. The  second  deformation  phase  resulted  in  development  of 
NE-NNE trending faults, stockwork veins (V2) and NE trending foliation (S2) associated with dextral 
shear  zones, 
interpreted  as  Eburnean  (D2)  structures. The  sequences  underwent  contact 
metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies during the intrusion of granitoid plutons (syn-Eburnean). || Chapter 1 
1.1 Introduction 
The Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt is located in north-eastern Burkina Faso (Fig. 1.1) in the West 
African  craton,  and  extends  into  the  neighbouring  Niger. The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by 
meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et 
al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can 
be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have 
identified  that    quartz-vein  hosted  gold  in the  Birimian  of  West  African  craton  can  be  attributed  to 
deformation in the Eburnean Orogeny (Hastings, 1982; Milési et al., 1992; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 1993; 
Béziat et al., 2008). || Chapter 5: Observations 
Mineralogy, Petrography and Ore petrology1 
5.1 Preamble 
Fifteen polished thin sections were analysed for this project, with five thin sections from each deposit. The  petrography  section  aims  to  realise  the  main  aims  and  objectives  of  the  project. In  the  thin 
sections the rock types, mineralogy of the rocks, alteration types and microstructures were identified 
to determine a paragenetic sequence for the gold occurring in the Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt. The dominant sulphides included arsenopyrite and pyrite, with minor sphalerite, hematite, magnetite, 
chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. 5.2 Essakane 
The Essakane deposit is hosted in an inclined, asymmetrical NW-NNW trending anticline. The rock 
types that were identified in the thin sections are sandstone, siltstone, shale and volcaniclastics (Fig 
5.1). || Chapter 7: Conclusion 
The  rock  sequences  in  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  underwent  regional  metamorphism 
characterised by greenschist facies mineral assemblages, with the development of hornblende-hornfels 
assemblages  during  contact  metamorphism. The  sequences  were  cross-cut  by  quartz  and  quartz-
carbonate  dominant  veins. The  events leading  up  to  the  formation  of the ore  can  be  summarised as 
follows: 
1. The  deposition  of  lithologies  on  the  greenstone  belt,  which  include  interbedded  shale-
siltstone-sandstone and volcaniclastic sedimentary sequences. 2. The  regional  metamorphic  event  led  metamorphism  and  deformation  of  the  sequences, 
characterised  by  the  development  of  greenschist  facies  mineral  assemblages  and  NW-NNW 
trending structures (D1) and NE-NNE trending structures (D2). || The deformation D3 is not defined in the Oudalan-
Gorouol  greenstone  belt,  but  is  well  developed  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  and  post-dates  the 
Eburnean orogeny (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2009). The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  sequences  were  sheared  by  a  first-order  crustal  scale  structure,  the 
Markoye  Shear  Zone,  which  marks  the  western  boundary  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt 
7 || Two of the three sites i.e. Falagountou and Sokadie are still artisanal mining sites and 
Essakane is a developing mine. Essakane is the main deposit and is 11km×3km in dimension, with 
Falagountou  and  Sokadie  located  to  the  East  and  south  of  the  Essakane  metasedimentary  belt, 
respectively (Kerr(b), 2004). The  dominant  stratigraphic  sequences  that  have  been  identified  in  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone 
belt are a volcaniclastic greywacke sequence and an interbedded conglomerate-greywacke-siltstone-
shale  sequence,  which  have  been  contact  metamorphosed  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies  during  the 
emplacement  of  igneous  bodies  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). The  environment  of  deposition  is 
interpreted to be a shallow marine continental shelf (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The  supracrustal  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  have  experienced  two  deformation 
events  that  resulted  in  the  formation  of  shears,  folds,  mylonite  zones  and  regional  metamorphism; 
contact  metamorphism  resulted  from  the  dolerite  dykes  intruding  the  area  and  the  emplacement  of 
syn- and post-orogenic plutons (Tshibubudze et al., 2009).",llm,GEOLOGICAL_UNIT,,,no-geocode-result,no-geocode-result,

formed during the Eburnean orogeny subsequent to the intrusion and cooling of granitoid plutons. The 
mineralisation  occurred  during  post  peak  metamorphism  and  is  defined  by  chloritisation  of  the 
sequences. The  mineralogy  indicates  that  the  deposits  are  situated  proximal  (middle-aureole)  to  the

The metamorphic rocks in the Sokadie deposit are strongly deformed with well developed foliation,

shear zone. The shear zone is characterised by intensely foliated, crenulated, chloritised greenschist 
rocks. The  greenschist  rocks  are  composed  of  quartz,  plagioclase,  epidote,  chlorite,  muscovite  with 
developed of arsenopyrite. The quartz-carbonate veins cross-cutting this unit are intensely folded and boudinaged, and brecciated 
buck quartz veins occur within the shear zone. The rock outcrops become progressively sheared when

Ghana, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire. The official language is French, with Mooré and Dioula. The religion 
dominantly practised is Islam with >50% of the population being Muslim, the remaining religions are 
Christianity and indigenous African religions. Burkina Faso is defined by low hills and alluvial plains and is covered by an extensive laterite plateau
