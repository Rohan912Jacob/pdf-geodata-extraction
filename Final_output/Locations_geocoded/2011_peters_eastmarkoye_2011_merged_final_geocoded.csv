Pacific  Plate  is  thrust  beneath  the  Australian  Plate  obliquely. The  angle  of  subduction  has

systems that lie between the fore-arc basin and the Wanganui Basin. || according to Leube et al. (1990) and Milesi et al. (1991) is classified as being predominantly 
conglomerate units with smaller sandstone and phyllite units. The  formation  of  thick  greywacke  sequences  generally  relates  to  rapid  deposition  as  to 
disallow  sorting  of  material. In  review  of  large  greywacke  units  in  modern  day  or  recent 
geological  environments,  the  Wanganui  Basin  in  New  Zealand  is  described  by  Carter  and 
Naish  (1998)  and  Proust  et  al. (2005)  as  a  shallow  marine  environment  that  is  Plio-

Naish  (1998)  identified  that  equal  amounts  of  sedimentation  and  subsidence  are  necessary. Uplift  and  subsidence  were,  in  the  case  of  the  Wanganui  Basin,  controlled  by  eustatic 
changes which created an environment prone to rapid deposition. The Wanganui Basin sits in 
a  back-arc  setting  at  the  convergence  of  the  Pacific  Plate  with  the  Australian  Plate. It  is 
possible  that  its  formation  occurred  in  the  same  environment. Lithospheric  loading  and

The  WAC,  namely  the  Birimian  Supergroup,  consists  of  many  island  arc  terranes  that 
underwent terrane accretion (2300-2250 Ma). This occurred during the process of subduction, 
thus  creating  a  felsic  continental  crust  due  to  its  association  with  TTG,  calc-alkaline 
plutonism (Klein and Moura., 2009). Following this, other cratonic blocks  which formed in 
the  same  way,  collided  with  the  accreted  arcs  to  form  orogenic  belts  and  the  closure  of  an 
oceanic basin. The Eburnean Orogeny is an example of this process (Hirdes et al., 1996; Hein 
et al., 2004; Feybesse et al., 2006). The OGGB is one of the island arc terranes, and the east
