cleavage of 343o/54E, however the data can be resolved into two data sets: a NNW trending set and a NE-
trending set (Fig. 7). Two sets of cleavages were also observed by Hein (2009) in which the ENE trending 
sets  (S2)  cross-cuts  the  NNW-trending  sets  (S1). Unfortunately  this  cross-cutting  relationship  has  not 
been observed in the study area, but is accepted by the mine as a tectonic sequence for the Sadiola pit. || Rose diagrams for quartz veins from the Helicopter Pit and the west high-wall are presented in Figure 8.

towards NNW. The quartz veins elsewhere in the main pit are folded by F2 (Hein, 2009) indicating that 
the  veins  formed  prior  to  S2. The  relationship  between  S1  in  the  Helicopter  Pit  and  the  dominant 
orientation of quartz veins suggest that they formed at the same time during the NE directed compression. This is because bedding and cleavage verge towards NE. A

zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991;

Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold 
deposit. The  Sadiola  open  cast  occurs  with  the  FE3  and  FE4  open  cast  within  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments 
which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism 
reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral 
assemblages. The Sadiola deposit is hosted by the Kofi Formation which is currently undated. The Kofi 
Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates. || CHAPTER 6: Conclusion 
•  The mineral assemblages of the Sadiola open cast are representative of greenschist metamorphic 
facies. •  Sadiola lithologies underwent at least two deformation events: one associated with the Tangaean 
event (D1) and the latter associated with the Eburnean orogeny (D2). •  The  quartz  veins  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  in  the  D1  event  during  a  NE-directed 
compression. •  Sadiola  lithologies  underwent  two  metamorphic  events:  regional  metamorphism  to  lower 
greenschist facies and contact metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies. •  Gold  mineralisation  is  associated  with  a  variety  of  alteration  system  with  pyrite-arsenopyrite 
mineral assemblage. •  Mineralisation  tends  to  occur  along  the  carbonate-greywacke  contact  which  is  from  the  inner 
contact aureole to the middle aureole. || Metamorphism at Sadiola reached hornblende-hornfels facies as a result of 
the emplacement of tonalite-granodiorite plutons and the tonalite dykes  (Hein and Tshibubudze,  2007a, 
b). 3.4 Gold Mineralisation 
Three  types  of  gold  mineralisation  have  been  recognised  in  the  West  African  Craton. These  are  pre-
orogenic,  syn-orogenic  and  late-orogenic  mineralisation. Mineralisation  is  related  to  regional  tectonic 
event (Milesi et al, 1992; Beziat et al., 2008). Pre-orogenic deposits are associated with early extensional 
zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991; 
Fouillac et al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). Syn-orogenic mineralisation is associated with mineralisation in 
disseminated  sulphides  in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rock  (Milési  et  al.,  1992). || Mineralisation  at  Sadiola  has  been  shown  to  have  a  temporal  and  a  spatial 
relationship to the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and tonalite dykes. Sadiola is located in close proximity to 
the  Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian  plutonic  system. Mineralisation  has  shown  to  be  as  a  result  of  the 
fluids and metamorphism associated with the intrusions (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Determining the 
paragenesis,  investigation  of  the  mineralogical,  microstructural  and  alteration  events  will  assist  in 
determining  gold  mineralisation,  and  is  considered  important  for  the  Sadiola  exploration  and  in-mine 
development. 1.2  Location and Physiography 
The  Sadiola  opencast  mine  is  located  within  the  Sadiola  village. The  village  is  situated  in  the  south-
western part of Mali at about 77km south of the regional capital, Kayes (Fig. || The alteration types recorded in the host rocks are potassic, silicification, dolomitisation, chlorite-biotite 
alteration,  calc-silicate  and  sulphidation. The  common  sulphide  minerals  are  pyrite,  arsenopyrite  and 
pyrrhotite  with minor  magnetite and sphalerite. The following paragenetic sequence is observed for the 
ore  mineralogy:  pyrite  –  chalcopyrite  -  (+  sphalerite)  –  arsenopyrite. Gold is  paragenetically  associated 
with pyrite and arsenopyrite. The rocks also show evidence of deformation through kinked biotite and the 
development  of stylolites. Two metamorphic events are recorded at Sadiola: regional metamorphism to 
greenschist facies and contact metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies. || intrusions. The mineralisation at Sadiola  is therefore interpreted to be as a result of metamorphism and 
deformation  brought  about  the  Sekokoto  pluton  emplacement  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny. Structural 
data  indicate  that  quartz  veins  formed  prior  to  the  development  of  the  S2  cleavage  systems. These  are 
therefore  interpreted  to  be  post-Tangaean  and  pre-Eburnean  and  are  associated  with  minor  pyrite-
arsenopyrite  mineralisation. Mineralisation  was  therefore  upgraded  by  pluton  emplacement  and  the  re-
activation  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  the  remobilisation  of  fluids  to  cause  brecciation  and 
skarnification of the carbonate unit. The fluids have moderate to high salinity as determined by Pan and 
Fleet (1992) from calcite-dolomite geothermometry.","llm,rules",PLACE,13.891613,-11.7054385,"Sadiola, Kayes Cercle, Kayes, Mali",APPROXIMATE,

Tshibubudze  et  al.,  (2009)  in  the  Markoye  Shear  Zone  in  Burkina  Faso. The  first  deformation  is 
characterized  by  the  development  of  NNW-trending  folds  (F1). NNW  bedding  and  cleavage  (S1) 
orientation associated with D1 are recorded in the study area. This deformation is termed the Tangaean 
Event and formed during the NE-SW shortening period. Quartz veins formed during this event and their 
dominant trend is towards NNE-NE. The second deformation event is characterized by the development of ENE-ESE trending folds (F2) and 
NE-trending  cleavage  (S2). || 5.4 Comparison to Sadiola goldfield with the rest of the West African Gold deposits 
The Sadiola deposits share some similarities with the other gold deposits in the West African Craton. In 
the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are 
gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite-
pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold 
systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008) 
with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation. Two  styles  of 
mineralisation  observed  in  Burkina  Faso  are  quartz-vein  and  disseminated  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008). || CHAPTER 1: Introduction 
1.1  Preamble 
The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3 
and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société 
d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit 
(Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001). || Late-orogenic  deposits  are 
characterised by disseminated gold-bearing arsenopyrite and Au-quartz lode and quartz-vein type. These 
are interpreted as the major type and host of gold in West Africa (Milési et al., 1991).Two metallogenic 
styles  have  been  observed  in  the  Sadiola  goldfield  by  Hein  and  Tshibubudze  (2007a,  b)  and  these  are 
placer gold in the palaeochannels and screes and gold occurring in stockwork veins and breccias. 15 || Liégeois  et  al. (1991) concluded  that  metamorphism was  syn-tectonic  based  on the orientation  of  sheet 
silicates  and  amphiboles. The  KKI  sediments  were  then  intruded  by  various  granitiod  plutons  which 
caused further metamorphism (Dioh et al., 2006). The four types of granitoids that intruded the sediments 
of  the  KKI  are  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids,  amphibole  bearing  granitoids,  pyroxene  and  K-bearing 
granitoids  and  the  peraluminous  biotite  bearing  units  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). In  the  Sadiola  goldfield,  two 
metamorphic  events  are  recorded:  regional  metamorphism 
to  greenschist  facies  and  contact

Mapping was undertaken in two areas in the Sadiola open  cast: West high-wall in the  main pit and the 
Helicopter pit located at the southern end of the main pit (Map 1 & 2). The main lithologies observed in 
the main pit are metagreywacke and carbonates. The greywacke sequence is massive in texture and the 
visible  mineralogy  includes  quartz,  calcite,  minor  sulphide  and  epidote  in  some  cases. The  carbonate 
sequence  becomes  friable  and  less  competent  at  the  contact  with  the  carbonaceous-siltstone  greywacke 
unit. This unit is interpreted as the Sadiola Fracture Zone (SFZ) as defined by Hein (2009) and Boshoff et 
al (1998). Pyrolusite, epidote and kaolinite occur in this zone and the zone is cross-cut by quartz veins. || Abstract 
Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold 
deposit. The  Sadiola  open  cast  occurs  with  the  FE3  and  FE4  open  cast  within  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments 
which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism 
reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral 
assemblages. The Sadiola deposit is hosted by the Kofi Formation which is currently undated. The Kofi 
Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates. || Brecciation  occurred  in  the  marble  and  is 
attributed  to  have  resulted  from  the  fluids  passing  through  the  rock. This  is  consistent  with  the 
interpretation of Theron’s (1997a) that gold skarns develop where carbonates are present. These fluids are 
also  responsible  for  the  deposition  of  calcite  and  sulphide  (mainly  pyrite)  in  the  open  spaces. The 
occurrence  of  albite  is  interpreted  as  a  result  of  the  hydrothermal  introduction  of  Na  into  the  system 
(Theron, 1997a). The fluids at the Sadiola open cast are therefore interpreted to be hydrothermal in origin. The texture displayed by the biotite (Fig.",llm,PLACE,13.891613,-11.7054385,"Sadiola, Kayes Cercle, Kayes, Mali",APPROXIMATE,

conclusion can thus be made that the rocks of the Sadiola open cast mine underwent at least two phases of 
deformation. 5.3 Petrographic Interpretation

The West African Craton (Fig. 2) is a piece of continental crust that has been stable since approximately 
1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The 
Reguibat Rise and the Man terrains are composed of Archaean to Proterozoic rock formations (Potrel et 
al., 1998) with the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Man shield referred to as the Birimian sequence (Beziat 
et al., 2000). The Kêniêba and Kayes inliers are situated towards the western border of Senegal and Mali (Fig. || Metamorphism at Sadiola reached hornblende-hornfels facies as a result of

b). 3.4 Gold Mineralisation 
Three  types  of  gold  mineralisation  have  been  recognised  in  the  West  African  Craton. These  are  pre-
orogenic,  syn-orogenic  and  late-orogenic  mineralisation. Mineralisation  is  related  to  regional  tectonic 
event (Milesi et al, 1992; Beziat et al., 2008). Pre-orogenic deposits are associated with early extensional 
zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991; 
Fouillac et al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). Syn-orogenic mineralisation is associated with mineralisation in 
disseminated  sulphides  in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rock  (Milési  et  al.,  1992). || Abstract 
Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold 
deposit. The  Sadiola  open  cast  occurs  with  the  FE3  and  FE4  open  cast  within  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments 
which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism 
reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral 
assemblages. The Sadiola deposit is hosted by the Kofi Formation which is currently undated. The Kofi 
Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates.","llm,rules",GEOLOGICAL_UNIT,,,no-geocode-result,no-geocode-result,

Data Collection 
This research comprised two important tasks: petrographical work and field work which were preceded 
by  literature  review. Field  work  was  completed  in  June  2009  and  involved  examining  drill-core  and 
mapping  of  the  host  rocks. Six  drill  cores  from  the  Sadiola  Deep  Sulphide  project  were  examined  and 
these  include  SD022,  SD042,  SD048,  SD119,  SD129  and  SD782. Samples  were  collected  in  2008  and 
polished thin sections were prepared by SGS Laboratories in Booysens, Johannesburg. Field  mapping  involved  mapping  of  the  West  High-Wall  of  the  main  pit  and  the  Helicopter  pit  at  the 
southern  end  of  the  main  Sadiola  pit. At  each  station  point  the  following  (if  present)  were  recorded:
