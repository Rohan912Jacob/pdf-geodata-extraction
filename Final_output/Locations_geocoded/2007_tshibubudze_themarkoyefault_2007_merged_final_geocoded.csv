2.1 Preamble 
The  West  African  Craton  is  composed  of an Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic basement 
that  is  divided  into  the  Reguibat  Rise  in  the  north  and  the  Leo-Man  Rise  in  the  south 
(Thiéblemont et al., 2004). These two are separated by the Taoudeni basin, which is of 
upper  Proterozoic  to  Devonian  age  (Fig. 1). The  Leo-Man  Rise  is  composed  of  two 
domains, the Kénéma-Man domain in the south west and the Baoule-Mossi domain in the 
east (Feybesse et al., 2006). The area of study is situated within the Leo-Man Rise in the 
Palaeoproterozoic  Baoule-Mossi  domain. The  Kénéma-Man  domain  is  Archaean  in  age 
and dated at 3542-3535 Ma (U-Pb zircon, Thiéblemont et al., 2001, 2004). || The Baoule-
Mossi domain is Palaeoproterozoic in age and consists of Birimian sequences that where 
accreted  at  around  2100  Ma  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Milési  et  al.,  1991,  1992; 
Boher  et  al.,  1992). The  syn-tectonic  emplacement  of  granitoids  during  accretion 
occurred  at  around  2190-2108  Ma  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  (Hirdes  and  Davis,

conducted  before  the  actual  field  work  commenced. Several  east-west  traverses  were 
conducted  across  the  Markoye  fault  between  Essakane  and  Tambăo  (Fig.1  and  2). For 
each station point mapped, lithological and structural data was recorded, a photographic 
record was made, GPS position was established using UTM grid co-ordinates (WGS 84), 
and if appropriate, samples were collected for petrographic studies. The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the 
geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  Garmin  Geographic  Positioning  System

The West African Craton hosts many mineral deposits, for example, gold, diamond, iron, 
and  manganese,  silver,  lead  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). Several 
deposits and deposit styles occur in the study area including; (1) The manganese deposit 
at  Tambăo  close  to  border  with  Niger  (Fig. 2),  (2)  gold  mineralization  at  Essakane, 
Gosséy, Koiréziéna, Falagountou (Fig. || Structural  studies  indicate  that  the  NE-trending  Markoye  fault,  which  is  the  first-order 
crustal-scale  structure,  have  undergone  at  least  two  phases  of  deformation,  D1  and  D2, 
with reactivation during the late phase of D2. D1 resulted in formation of NW-trending 
asymmetric folds and thrusts at Essakane, and the displacement along the Markoye fault 
was dextral reverse. D2 is a period of SE-NW crustal shortening that formed NE-trending 
folds,  and  NE-trending  regional  foliation. The  NE-trending  mylonite  to  ultramylonite 
zone, pseudotachylyte veins, buck quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline) veins and quartz iron-
rich catalasite vein, and late quartz-chlorite shears formed during D2. D1 is interpreted to pre-date the Eburnean Orogeny, and D2 is correlated to the Eburnean 
Orogeny ~2.1 G.a. The name ‘Markoye Fault’ should be changed to Markoye Shear Zone 
(MSZ) to reflect the complex nature of the structure and tectonic history. || The presence of black shale and siltstone at Essakane provides evidence of fine material

The  regional  lithological  and  structural  mapping  completed  in  the  north-eastern  part  of 
Burkina Faso indicates that the Essakane goldfield of the West African Craton is hosted 
by  meta-volcanoclastic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  sequences. The 
sequences  are  dominated  by  meta-volcanoclastic  greywackes,  intercalated  meta-
conglomerate,  meta-sandstone-greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale. The  sequences  have 
primary sedimentary structures preserved as compositional layering. The  depositional  environment  of  the  sequences  is  interpreted  to  have  occurred  in  a 
shallow  marine  continental  shelf  environment  at  a  delta  front  setting. The  sequences 
where  subjected  to  several  phases  of  deformation  and  metamorphism. They  have  been 
contact metamorphosed to hornblende hornfels facies during emplacement of adamellite, 
pyroxenite-gabbro, granodiorite-tonalite plutons, and dolerite dykes. || Chapter 7: Conclusion 
The Markoye fault is a broad zone of faulting, shearing, mylonite zone, pseudotachylyte 
veins, L-tectonites, quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins and quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline) 
veins and is renamed as the Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ). The  lithologies  of  Essakane  goldfield  consist  of  metamorphosed  Birimian  volcano-
sedimentary  and  sedimentary  sequences  that  were  deposited  in  a  shallow  marine 
continental shelf at a delta front setting. These sequences have been intruded by plutonic 
rocks  that  include  granodiorite-tonalite,  pyroxenite-gabbro,  granite  (adamellite)  plutons 
and dolerite dykes. The plutons and dyke systems have contact metamorphosed the rocks 
of  the  region  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies,  but  primary  sedimentary  structures  are 
preserved as compositional layers. All the lithologies in the area have been subjected to 
several phases of local-regional deformation, with development of mylonite, schistosity, 
and L-tectonite. Two phases of deformation are recognised related to the Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ) in 
the  area. || However most of the published ages in Figure 22 imply syn-depositional emplacement. (3) In Figure 22 the ages for granite suite rocks are younger than, or, synchronous to, the 
emplacement of tonalite suite rocks. At Essakane goldfield granite xenoliths are hosted in 
tonalite, which means that the granite suite is older than the tonalite suite. Consequently the data set shows inconsistencies and this needs further investigation. 46 || However, little or 
no research has been undertaken to develop an understanding of first order crustal scale 
structures and their relationship to gold mineralization in the Essakane goldfield. This is 
the purpose of this report. || The 
pegmatite  vein  is  ±40  cm  thick,  and  it  trends  NE. It  is  a  plagioclase-tourmaline-topaz 
pegmatite with crystals greater than 10cm in size. 4.7.4 Dolerite 
A series of parallel NW-trending, mafic magnetic dolerite dykes crosscut the study area. They are composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and magnetite and  commonly  exhibit 
granophyric texture in thin section. The mineralogical composition is given in Figure 10. The  dykes  crosscut  greywacke-siltstone  sequences  at  the  Essakane  goldfield  and  have 
contact  metamorphosed  these  sequences  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies. || The early phase of D2 is associated with medium to high grade metamorphic conditions 
with  high  strain  along  the  MSZ  and  formation  of  the  MMZ  and  pseudotachylyte  veins 
(Fig. 2). Quartz  iron-rich  cataclasite  veins  and  buck  quartz-carbonate  (±  tourmaline) 
veins  in  quartz-chlorite  shears  crosscut  the  MMZ  and  are  interpreted  to  represent  low 
strain rates during progressive deformation on the MSZ. Quartz-chlorite shear zones are 
gold bearing at Essakane goldfield. 6.5 Relative and Absolute chronologies (Tectonic history) 
Although  absolute  dating  can  delineate  separate  stratigraphic  sequences  and  tectonic 
events based on heavy or light mineral analysis, these minerals are rarely available and 
the analyses are limited by availability of resources. Due to geological processes that are 
continuously  taking  place,  including,  erosion,  deposition  and  tectonic  events,  complete 
stratigraphic  sequences  are  rarely  available  to  define  absolute  ages,  and  therefore,  it  is 
generally  simple  to  establish  the  spatial  and  temporal  relationship  of  the  various 
geological  features  in  the  region  by  establishing  the  crosscutting  relationships. || The gold mineralization in the Essakane goldfield is related to the 
late quartz-chlorite schist of D2. 48 || However most of the published ages in Figure 22 imply syn-depositional emplacement. (3) In Figure 22 the ages for granite suite rocks are younger than, or, synchronous to, the 
emplacement of tonalite suite rocks. At Essakane goldfield granite xenoliths are hosted in 
tonalite, which means that the granite suite is older than the tonalite suite. Consequently the data set shows inconsistencies and this needs further investigation. 46","llm,rules",PLACE,16.781011,-3.6346771,"Essakane, Goundam Cercle, Timbuktu, Mali",APPROXIMATE,

The area of study is located ±250 km NE of the capital city, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso

countries  include  Mali,  Niger,  Benin,  Togo,  Ghana  and  Côte  d`Ivoire. The  official 
language is French. Other languages, local languages include Mooré and Dioula. || 2.6 Tarkwa Group 
The  Tarkwa  Group  is  defined  from  Ghana  as  clastic  meta-sedimentary  rocks  derived 
from  erosion  of  the  Birimian  sequences  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Milési  et  al.,  1991). The

including gold in sheeted and stockwork quartz veins, copper as malachite in buck quartz 
veins,  and  tourmaline  and  topaz  in  pegmatite  and  buck  quartz  veins  (Foster  and  Piper, 
1993; Lompo, 2001; Castaing et al., 2003). Foster and Piper (1993) have restricted gold 
mineralization of the West African Craton to the Eburnean tectonothermal event, but this 
does  not  include  gold  hosted  by  the  Tarkwa  Group  meta-sedimentary  units  in  Ghana 
(Milési  et  al.,  1991;  Feybesse  et  al.,  2006)  which  formed  after  the  Eburnean  event. Bossière  et  al. (1996)  concluded  that  the  Tarkwa  Group  meta-sedimentary  units  in  the 
study area have no economic value. 9 || Bossière  et  al. (1996)  established  that  the  metamorphosed  sequences  of  the  Tarkwa 
Group of Burkina Faso (in the study area) were different from those defined in Ghana, in 
that they contain euhedral zircons that suggest a short transportation distance. In the study 
area  the  Tarkwa  Group  meta-sedimentary  rocks  are  deformed. Their  deformation  has 
been attributed to the formation of sinistral shears and low grade metamorphism that is 
characterised by formation of muscovite (Bossière et al., 1996; Naba et al., 2004), which 
is  similar  to  what  has  been  defined  in  Ghana  by  Milési  et  al. (1989,  1991). They  were

the meta-sandstone unit. The Banket series is further divided into the Banket quartz lithic 
meta-sandstone unit and the Banket meta-conglomerate unit (Tunks et al., 2004). Kwesie

silica and black sands that are rich in heavy minerals including magnetite, ilmenite, rutile 
and  tourmaline  (Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1991;  Bossière  et  al.,  1996). The  Tarkwa  Group

conducted  before  the  actual  field  work  commenced. Several  east-west  traverses  were 
conducted  across  the  Markoye  fault  between  Essakane  and  Tambăo  (Fig.1  and  2). For 
each station point mapped, lithological and structural data was recorded, a photographic 
record was made, GPS position was established using UTM grid co-ordinates (WGS 84), 
and if appropriate, samples were collected for petrographic studies. The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the 
geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  Garmin  Geographic  Positioning  System

5.1 Preamble 
The Markoye fault is ~5 km wide and is NE-trending. It is a composite structure of faults, 
shears,  L-tectonites,  zones  of  mylonitisation  and  pseudotachylyte  veins. It  hosts  an  en 
echelon  buck  quartz-carbonate  vein  array. The  structure  has  undergone  two  phases  of 
brittle-ductile  deformation  and  at  least  two  phases  of  reactivation  are  recognised. D1 
resulted in the development of the NW-trending asymmetric fold (F1), and the sense of 
displacement on the Markoye fault was dextral (reverse). D2 marked a period of sinistral 
(reverse)  displacement  on  the  Markoye  fault  with  refolding  of  F1  to  form  NE-trending 
folds (F2). || Chapter 7: Conclusion 
The Markoye fault is a broad zone of faulting, shearing, mylonite zone, pseudotachylyte 
veins, L-tectonites, quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins and quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline)

strike-slip system. 2.9 Regional metallogeny 
The West African Craton hosts many mineral deposits, for example, gold, diamond, iron, 
and  manganese,  silver,  lead  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). Several 
deposits and deposit styles occur in the study area including; (1) The manganese deposit 
at  Tambăo  close  to  border  with  Niger  (Fig. 2),  (2)  gold  mineralization  at  Essakane, 
Gosséy, Koiréziéna, Falagountou (Fig. || It is medium to 
coarse,  and  composed  of  millimetre-sized  crystals  of  potassium  feldspar,  quartz, 
plagioclase, biotite and hornblende in a quartz-feldspar rich groundmass (Fig. 6, a, b and 
c). Adjacent to the Markoye fault the granite is foliated and lineated. 4.7.2 Yacouba Mafic Complex (YMC) 
The YMC is located NE of the Gosséy orpaillage (Fig. 2). It is composed of pyroxenite 
and gabbro layers. || Structural  studies  indicate  that  the  NE-trending  Markoye  fault,  which  is  the  first-order 
crustal-scale  structure,  have  undergone  at  least  two  phases  of  deformation,  D1  and  D2, 
with reactivation during the late phase of D2. D1 resulted in formation of NW-trending 
asymmetric folds and thrusts at Essakane, and the displacement along the Markoye fault 
was dextral reverse. D2 is a period of SE-NW crustal shortening that formed NE-trending 
folds,  and  NE-trending  regional  foliation. The  NE-trending  mylonite  to  ultramylonite 
zone, pseudotachylyte veins, buck quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline) veins and quartz iron-
rich catalasite vein, and late quartz-chlorite shears formed during D2. D1 is interpreted to pre-date the Eburnean Orogeny, and D2 is correlated to the Eburnean 
Orogeny ~2.1 G.a. The name ‘Markoye Fault’ should be changed to Markoye Shear Zone 
(MSZ) to reflect the complex nature of the structure and tectonic history. || The pseudotachylyte veins are interpreted 
to have formed during high strain conditions, the resulting frictional heat melting the host 
rock (Davis and Reynolds, 1996). Quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins (Fig. 18, a, b, c) outcrops west of the Yacouba Mafic 
Complex  (YMC)  (Fig.2). The  cataclasite  veins  trends  067º  and  crosscut  the  YMC. The 
cataclasite veins are interpreted to have formed during local dilation of the Markoye fault. Quartz-chlorite  shear  crosscut  the  cataclasite  and  the  YMC  as  well  indicating  that  the 
quartz-chlorite shears are younger than the YMC and the cataclasite. || The quartz-chlorite shears are NE-trending. The schitosity measurements are represented

- Formation of NW-trending folds (F1) and thrusts during SW-directed compression with 
dextral reverse movement on the Markoye fault. -  Formation  of  NE-trending  folds  (F2)  during  SE-NW  compression  with  sinistral 
(reverse) displacement on the Markoye fault with development of mylonite zone (MMZ) 
and pseudotachylyte veins and quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins. || Structural  studies  indicate  that  the  NE-trending  Markoye  fault,  which  is  the  first-order

established  that  meta-volcanic  and  meta-pyroclastic  units  are  interbedded  with  meta-
sedimentary rocks throughout the type locality in the Goren Greenstone Belt, and thus the 
stratigraphy of the NE of Burkina Faso may need revision. 2.4 Intrusive complexes 
During  the  polycyclic  Eburnean  Orogeny  numerous  calc-alkaline  plutons  intruded  the 
Palaeoproterozoic sequences (Pawlig et al., 2006) including tonalite (TTG), granodiorite, 
diorite  and  meta-diorite,  and  these  are  collectively  called  Eburnean  granitoids  (Pons  et 
5 || (1996), but the stratigraphic order 
was not defined. The three main units include: (1) a meta-pelite unit, (2) meta-sandstone 
unit  and  (3)  a  meta-conglomerate  unit  containing  angular  clasts  of  quartzitic  and 
micaceous lithic fragments of rhyolite, chert and schist. 2.7 Structure  
Several regional tectono-metamorphic events are recognised in the NE of Burkina Faso. In  studies  conducted  by  Feybesse  et  al. (1990),  Lompo  et  al. (1991),  and  Hein  et  al. || 2.8 Markoye Fault 
The first-order crustal-scale Markoye fault is located in the NE of Burkina Faso, west of 
the  international  border  intersection  of  Burkina  Faso,  Mali  and  Niger  (Fig.1). The  fault 
trends NE and is clearly visible in LANDSAT imagery (Fig. 2) and RTP magnetic data. According to Milési et al. (1989, 1992) and Castaing et al. (2003) the Markoye fault is 
the  boundary  that  separates  Eburnean  granitoids  to  the  west  from  the  Tarkwa  Group 
meta-sedimentary  units  in  the  east. || A granite suite which is localized along shear zones, intrudes both the 
Birimian and the TTG suite and was emplaced between 2150 and 2130 Ma (Castaing et 
al., 2003). Gabbro, meta-gabbro, diorite and trondhjemite intrusions are syn-tectonic with 
emplacement of Birimian meta-volcanic sequences (Béziat et al., 2000; Hein et al., 2004) 
and co-magmatic (Béziat et al., 2000). NE-trending dolerite dykes crosscut all Birimian, 
Tarkwa and intrusive complexes in the NE of Burkina Faso and are dated at 250±13 Ma 
(K-Ar whole rock dating) (Hottin and Ouedraogo, 1992). 2.5 Metamorphism 
The Birimian sequences were metamorphosed during the Eburnean Orogeny with further 
metamorphism  related  to  intrusion  of  granitoids. Metamorphic  grade  is  to  greenschist 
facies  (Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1991;  Bossière  et  al.,  1996;  Hirdes  et  al.,  1996),  with 
formation of chlorite and muscovite dominant mineral assemblages, and low to medium 
grade amphibolite facies, with hornblende and andalusite dominant mineral assemblages 
(Bossière  et  al.,  1996;  Béziat  et  al.,  2000;  Naba  et  al.,  2004)  particularly  in  the  contact 
aureole  of  granitoids  (Pawlig  et  al.,  2006). The  Tarkwa  Group  is  metamorphosed  to 
greenschist facies with development of chlorite and sericite (Milési et al., 1989, 1991). || The Baoule-
Mossi domain is Palaeoproterozoic in age and consists of Birimian sequences that where 
accreted  at  around  2100  Ma  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Milési  et  al.,  1991,  1992; 
Boher  et  al.,  1992). The  syn-tectonic  emplacement  of  granitoids  during  accretion 
occurred  at  around  2190-2108  Ma  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  (Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002). The  Tarkwa  Group  which  unconformably  overlies  the  Birimian  sequences  is 
regarded  by  some  as  the  erosional  product  of  the  Birimian  sequences  and  granitoids 
(Hastings, 1982; Leube et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1992; Castaing et al., 2003). 2.2 Stratigraphy 
The area of study is situated in the NE of Burkina Faso. The overall stratigraphy of the 
eastern part of Burkina Faso is established by the Palaeoproterozoic basement. The NE-

3.1 Data collection 
In  January  2007  a  detailed  structural  mapping  project  was  conducted  in  the  study  area 
over  a  period  of  20  days,  including  days  allocated  to  logistics  and  camp  management. Geology  and  topographic  maps,  and  airborne  magnetic  data  were  used  to  delineate  the 
Markoye  fault. Geographic  and  geologic  reconnaissance  studies  of  the  region  were 
conducted  before  the  actual  field  work  commenced. Several  east-west  traverses  were 
conducted  across  the  Markoye  fault  between  Essakane  and  Tambăo  (Fig.1  and  2). For 
each station point mapped, lithological and structural data was recorded, a photographic 
record was made, GPS position was established using UTM grid co-ordinates (WGS 84), 
and if appropriate, samples were collected for petrographic studies. The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the 
geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  Garmin  Geographic  Positioning  System 
(GPS) instrument. || In  Milési  et  al. (1989,  1991,  1992)  and  Hottin  and

data was not presented. Unpublished structural studies completed for Goldfields Mining

east-verging  thrust  (Rogers  and  Dong,  2000)  and  that  it  is  a  part  of  a  regional  dextral 
strike-slip system. 2.9 Regional metallogeny

The  regional  lithological  and  structural  mapping  completed  in  the  north-eastern  part  of 
Burkina Faso indicates that the Essakane goldfield of the West African Craton is hosted 
by  meta-volcanoclastic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  sequences. The 
sequences  are  dominated  by  meta-volcanoclastic  greywackes,  intercalated  meta-
conglomerate,  meta-sandstone-greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale. The  sequences  have 
primary sedimentary structures preserved as compositional layering. The  depositional  environment  of  the  sequences  is  interpreted  to  have  occurred  in  a 
shallow  marine  continental  shelf  environment  at  a  delta  front  setting. The  sequences 
where  subjected  to  several  phases  of  deformation  and  metamorphism. They  have  been 
contact metamorphosed to hornblende hornfels facies during emplacement of adamellite, 
pyroxenite-gabbro, granodiorite-tonalite plutons, and dolerite dykes. || Chapter 1: Introduction

The  NE-trending  Markoye  fault  in  Burkina  Faso  is  a  first-order  crustal  scale  structure 
located in the north-eastern part of Burkina Faso, between the towns of Dori and Tambão 
by the boarder with Mali and Niger (Fig. 1). The structure has been interpreted as a major 
westerly-dipping  thrust  (Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Hottin  and  Ouedraogo,  1992). Delfour  and 
Jeabrum (1970) in Rogers and Dong (2000) defined the structure as an east-verging thrust
