and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the 
Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average 
daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and

1.5. Thesis Organisation 
This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:- 
(1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related 
ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || 1.6. Limitations of the study 
A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political 
instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were 
restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against 
unnecessary  travel. The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area. However,  a 
comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano-
sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study. 21 || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages 
that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally, 
the  manganese-
carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary 
sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the 
Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich 
carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to 
classify the samples in order to characterize the tectonic setting for volcanic rocks of the GB. Geochemical data for volcanic rocks from the Boromo and Houndé belts, Oudalan-Gorouol belt 
and Tiebélé belt  were used in a comparative study of volcanic units across several different belts in 
Burkina Faso. Data from Baratoux et al. (2011) include 7 tholeiitic basalt samples and 6 calc-alkaline 
volcanic samples that were reported for the Boromo and Houndé belts in western Burkina Faso. Data 
from Ilboudo (2010) were reported for the Tiebélé region in the south of the country. Tshibubudze and 
Hein  (2013)  reported  data  for  two  meta-volcanic  samples  (major-elements  only)  from  the  Oudalan-
Gorouol belt (OGB) in the northeast of Burkina Faso. || Figure  1.1. Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern  Ghana. Volcano-

granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006; 
Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely 
the wet and dry seasons. The dry season occurs from October to May, which is followed by the wet 
season from June until September (Bierschenk, 1968; McFarland et al., 1998). Geographically,  the  capital  city  of  Ouagadougou  is  situated  at  the  centre  of  the  country. The 
Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  located  in  the  Sanmatenga  district. The  belt  is  elongate  and 
northwest-trending and extends from the towns of Kaya to Kongossi (Figure 1.1). The town of Kaya is 
approximately 90 km northeast of Ouagadougou and lies at the southeastern end of the belt. || 1.6. Limitations of the study

and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the 
Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average 
daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and 
northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages

the  manganese-

sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the

Event. || The volcanic facies were 
established through field and petrographic interpretations. The subaqueous facies architecture consists 
of proximal, coherent and autoclastic basaltic flow units containing porphyritic, aphyric, amygdaloidal 
and hyaloclastic textures as well as pillowed, jointed and flow-banded basaltic lithofacies. Proximal to 
distal volcanogenic manganese deposits intercalated with basalt flows indicate a syn-volcanic genesis. A  discrete  pyroclastic  interbed  (~300  m  thick)  within  a  volcanogenic,  marginal  marine  to  offshore 
greywacke succession occupies a distal facies relative to the volcanic source and indicates a bimodal 
source of volcanism, i.e., mafic and intermediate. Volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  are  characterized  by  quartz-ankerite  stockwork  breccia,  a 
braunite-ilmenite-magnetite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-(gold)  mineral  assemblage  and 
increased  Ba 
concentrations,  indicating  syn-volcanic  seafloor-related  hydrothermal  activity. The  Goren  volcano-

and base metal deposits. || Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely 
the wet and dry seasons. The dry season occurs from October to May, which is followed by the wet

Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  located  in  the  Sanmatenga  district. The  belt  is  elongate  and

pyroclastic deposits. Intercalated with this succession are mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks (Hein et

Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in

1.5. Thesis Organisation 
This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:- 
(1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related 
ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || Additionally, the southern 
GB  is  dominated  by  secondary  manganese  oxides  as  veins,  breccias,  tablets  and  colloform 
overgrowths  (Sections  4.3.5  and  5.2.3). These  overprinting  textures  resemble  typical  supergene 
alteration  found  in  the  Kuruman  manganese  deposits  in  the  Transvaal  Supergroup  of  South  Africa 
(Beyeme  Zogo,  2010),  suggesting  that  the  volcanogenic  system  underwent  supergene  alteration  at 
some stage. The  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  of  the  GB  resemble  the  Cyprus-type  volcanogenic 
manganese deposits defined by Mosier and Page (1988). Cyprus-type deposits occur as lenticular units 
bounded  between  volcanic  and  volcaniclastic  rocks,  and  can  be  proximal  to  distal  to  the  volcanic 
source. It is probably the case for the GB that the Mn-Fe-rich, carbonaceous sedimentary rocks formed 
as  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  in  a  proximal  to  distal  volcanic  setting. A  distal  setting  is 
indicated  by  low  Ba  concentrations,  fine-laminations  with  thin  ferruginous  chert,  and  dolomite 
interbeds, while a proximal setting is indicated because some Mn-Fe-rich units present an increase in 
oxides and Ba concentrations and increased base metal values. || the GB basalts could have extended into an intermediate facies, further away from the volcanic  vent 
from which they were erupted. 7.1.2. Sedimentary rocks of the south Goren belt 
Conformable  sedimentary  sequences  are  intercalated  with  basalt  flows  in  the  stratigraphic 
sequence  of  the  southern  GB. These  include  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sediments,  siltstone, 
volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit. Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  common  in  the  southern  GB  (Section  4.3.5; 
Hein  et  al.,  2004)  and,  in  fact,  throughout  the  WAC  (Section  1.1;  Blanchot  et  al.,  1972;  Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Neumann, 1988; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008; Beauvais

Buekes, 1996; Eriksson et al., 1993; Beyeme Zogo, 2010). || Although  considered  rare  in  mafic,  non-viscous  lavas,  flow 
banding has been recorded in the Archaean Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa (Robbins et al., 
2010) and occurs in the southern Bouroum belt in Burkina Faso (WAXI, 2013) (Figure 1.1). The  coherent  and  autoclastic  units  of  the  study  area  formed  as  a  result  of  effusive  eruptions. Effusive eruptions are typical of basaltic liquids, particularly when submerged beneath the confining 
water column. Effusive eruptions are characterized by the ability of lava to flow (low viscosity) rather 
than explode (Parfitt and Wilson, 2008) because volatiles escape passively through vesicle formation 
(McPhie et al., 1993; Bardintzeff and McBirney, 2000; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). The  coherent  and  autoclastic  facies  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  proximally  to  the  volcanic 
source. However, because basaltic lavas have low viscosities, they are able to flow laterally between 
tens and hundreds of metres before solidification.","llm,rules"

into olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel. In attempt to quantify the likelihood of phosphorus retention in the magma source in general for 
GB samples, a simple calculation was done (Appendix C) to determine how much  phosphorus could 
be retained in garnet and clinopyroxene in ancient magmas. The assumption was made that 0.05 wt%

Metallogenesis in the northeast of Burkina Faso includes gold, diamonds,  Mn-Fe, silver, lead, 
molybdenum,  copper  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1992;  Hein  et  al.,  2004; 
Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). In  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  belt,  manganese  deposits  occur  at  Tambão  and 
Billiata  (Figure  1.1)  and  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  the  Tin  Edia  deposit. Gold  occurrences 
include  commercially  mined  goldfields  such  as  Essakane,  Inata  and  Taparko  goldfields,  as  well  as 
artisanally mined deposits such as Falagountou artisanal mine. They occur as shear and quartz vein-
hosted deposits. Diamondiferous lamproite and lamprophyre plugs and dykes crop out NNW of Kaya 
in the Pissila batholith in the Barsalogo diamond field, with rare kimberlite pipes (WAXI, 2013). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-

proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages

the  manganese-
carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary 
sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the 
Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich 
carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to

was likely derived from a volcano-(plutonic) source nearby. The pyroclastic breccia unit of the GB is a polylithic, poorly bedded, poorly sorted deposit that

The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Figure  1.1. Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern  Ghana. Volcano-

settings are extremely difficult to distinguish, especially in ancient terranes  (Pearce, 1996;  Väisänen 
and Westerlund, 2007). It was suggested by Pearce (1996) that back-arc and/or intra-arc basin basalts 
should be referred to as transitional between back-arc basin basalts and intra-arc tholeiites (IAT) when 
geochemical  evidence  cannot  ascertain  the  correct  tectonic  setting. This  has  been  that  rationale 
adopted in this thesis. 7.3. The Goren belt in a regional context 
In  northeast  Burkina  Faso,  geochemical  analyses  of  of  volcanic  rocks  from  various  belts, 
including the Oudalan-Gorouol, Bouroum-Yalogo and Goren volcano-sedimentary belts suggest that 
deposition of supracrustal rocks occurred in island arc terranes, followed by the accretion of multiple 
arcs (WAXI,  2013). Vidal  et  al. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG 
granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006; 
Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || greenschist facies at most (WAXI, 2013). Regional metamorphism in the Eburnean Orogeny attained

grade amphibolite facies with the introduction of hornblende (Bossière et al., 1996; Béziat et al., 2000;

Gorouol belt on the margin of the Dori batholith in the Gorom Gorom region (Tshibubudze and Hein, 
2013), and in the Pissila batholith in the Saaba region (Simoko, 2012). Three deformation events are recognised in northeast Burkina Faso:

foliation. The  shortening  direction  was  SW-directed  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009;  Hein,  2010;

The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Distal 
versus proximal facies and coherent versus volcaniclastic facies can be interpreted using lithological 
relationships, volcanic textures and rock composition. For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern 
Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano-
sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with 
Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were 
leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and 
concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative 
processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the 
same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be 
juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology, 
sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic 
environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1) 
where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are 
intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe  
bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010). || The belt is weakly to moderately metamorphosed, giving 
a  unique  opportunity  to study  relatively  pristine  volcanic textures and  establish  volcanic  facies. The 
volcano-sedimentary  units  have  been  mapped,  sampled  in  detail  and  analysed  both  petrographically 
and  geochemically. From  field  studies,  geological  and  volcanic  facies  maps  were  created. This 
information  has  been  used  to  interpret  volcanic  setting. The  metallogenic  potential  of  the  southern

sedimentary  basins  in  western  Burkina  Faso  exhibited  complicated  strato-structural  relationships, 
making it difficult to establish local stratigraphy. However, recent studies by WAXI (2013) concluded 
that the stratigraphy of the WAC is dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of belts relative 
to accretionary terranes. Importantly, a detailed stratigraphic study was conducted by Baratoux et al. (2011) across three 
greenstone  belts  in  western  Burkina  Faso  (namely  the  Boromo,  Houndé  and  Banfora  belts)  (Figure 
1.1). Their  study  confirmed  that  the  belts  are  composed  of  calc-alkaline  andesite  and  dacite, 
intercalated  tuff  layers,  pyroclastic  flows,  Mn-Fe    rich  chert  layers  and  volcaniclastic  sedimentary

sequences  at  the  scale  of  one  or  several  belts  in  West  Africa. Few  studies  have  been  conducted  on 
volcanic facies and metal potential in terms of base metals and Mn mineralisation, but delineating the 
volcanic facies and alteration zones  of volcanic belts can help in identifying and targeting volcanic-
related mineral deposits. For example, the Mount Reid volcanics in western Tasmania and the Abitibi 
greenstone  belt  of  central  Canada  are  both  regions  where  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide 
mineralization  has  been  found. Their  volcanic  facies  and  alteration  zones  are  well  understood,

and flow breccias indicate autoclastic facies, which often occur  near coherent lavas (Lajoie and Stix, 
1992). Lavas can develop numerous textures, most because of cooling, such as those observed in the 
GB (e.g., hyaloclastites, jointing and volcanic glass). For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well 
preserved volcanic textures where the rocks are not strongly altered by hydrothermal processes and/or 
deformed  (McPhie  and  Allen,  2003). An  example  of  this  is  the  devitrification  of  volcanic  glass,  as 
described  by  McPhie  and  Allen  (op  cit.,  2003);  crystal  boundaries  remain  intact  and  the  glass 
recrystallises as zeolites with a minor proportion of clay minerals. As a further example, metamorphosed Triassic basalt lavas in NW Croatia were interpreted as 
proximal  to intermediate  facies  by  Palinkaš  et  al. (2008)  based  on  volcanic textures  such  as  closely
