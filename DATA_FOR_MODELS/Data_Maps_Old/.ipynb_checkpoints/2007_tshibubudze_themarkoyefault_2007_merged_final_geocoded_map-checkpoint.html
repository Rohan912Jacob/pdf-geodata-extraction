These  units  are  metamorphosed  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies through contact metamorphism, but primary sedimentary structures are preserved  as  compositional  layers  (Chapter  4). Primary  structures  include  graded  bedding,  flaser  and cross-bedding, fine laminations, ripple marks, slumps, and scour and fill. The  primary  structures  indicate  a  single  environment  of  deposition:  shallow  marine  continental shelf at a delta front setting. The fining up sequence (graded bedding), slumps  (gravity  flow),  mud  and  sand  balls,  lithic  fragments,  ripples,  scour  and  fill,  mud-cracks  and laminations in meta-volcanoclastic greywacke sequences suggest that the setting was  subjected  to  tidal  and  or  turbidity  currents  (Eriksson  et  al.,  1998;  2005;  Sultan  and  Björklund, 2006). The upward-fining, laminations, slumps, lithic fragments, and graded  beds, with scour and fill bases, are characteristic of  turbidity  currents  that operates at a  delta  front  (Shanmugan,  1997;  Sultan  and  Björklund,  2006),  and  the  ripples  are  characteristic of tidal currents (Sultan and Björklund, 2006).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Björklund, Huddinge, Huddinge kommun, Stockholm County, 141 92, Sweden<br><b>Pages:</b> 47<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Delfour  and  Jeabrum (1970) in Rogers and Dong (2000) defined the structure as an east-verging thrust  and  BHP  geologists  interpreted  the  structure  as  part  of  a  regional  dextral  strike-slip  system.

Geology  and  topographic  maps,  and  airborne  magnetic  data  were  used  to  delineate  the  Markoye  fault. Geographic  and  geologic  reconnaissance  studies  of  the  region  were  conducted  before  the  actual  field  work  commenced. Several  east-west  traverses  were  conducted  across  the  Markoye  fault  between  Essakane  and  Tambăo  (Fig.1  and  2). For  each station point mapped, lithological and structural data was recorded, a photographic  record was made, GPS position was established using UTM grid co-ordinates (WGS 84),  and if appropriate, samples were collected for petrographic studies. The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the  geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  Garmin  Geographic  Positioning  System  (GPS) instrument. || Figure  11.

Several  deposits and deposit styles occur in the study area including; (1) The manganese deposit  at  Tambăo  close  to  border  with  Niger  (Fig. 2),  (2)  gold  mineralization  at  Essakane,  Gosséy, Koiréziéna, Falagountou (Fig. || Structural  studies  indicate  that  the  NE-trending  Markoye  fault,  which  is  the  first-order  crustal-scale  structure,  have  undergone  at  least  two  phases  of  deformation,  D1  and  D2,  with reactivation during the late phase of D2. D1 resulted in formation of NW-trending  asymmetric folds and thrusts at Essakane, and the displacement along the Markoye fault  was dextral reverse. D2 is a period of SE-NW crustal shortening that formed NE-trending  folds,  and  NE-trending  regional  foliation. The  NE-trending  mylonite  to  ultramylonite  zone, pseudotachylyte veins, buck quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline) veins and quartz iron- rich catalasite vein, and late quartz-chlorite shears formed during D2. D1 is interpreted to pre-date the Eburnean Orogeny, and D2 is correlated to the Eburnean  Orogeny ~2.1 G.a. The name ‘Markoye Fault’ should be changed to Markoye Shear Zone  (MSZ) to reflect the complex nature of the structure and tectonic history. || The presence of black shale and siltstone at Essakane provides evidence of fine material  deposited  by  suspension  settling  at  the  delta  front  (Eriksson  et  al.,  1998;  Sultan  and  Björklund,  2006).

The  sequences  are  dominated  by  meta-volcanoclastic  greywackes,  intercalated  meta- conglomerate,  meta-sandstone-greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale. The  sequences  have  primary sedimentary structures preserved as compositional layering. The  depositional  environment  of  the  sequences  is  interpreted  to  have  occurred  in  a  shallow  marine  continental  shelf  environment  at  a  delta  front  setting. The  sequences  where  subjected  to  several  phases  of  deformation  and  metamorphism. They  have  been  contact metamorphosed to hornblende hornfels facies during emplacement of adamellite,  pyroxenite-gabbro, granodiorite-tonalite plutons, and dolerite dykes. || Chapter 7: Conclusion  The Markoye fault is a broad zone of faulting, shearing, mylonite zone, pseudotachylyte  veins, L-tectonites, quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins and quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline)  veins and is renamed as the Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ). The  lithologies  of  Essakane  goldfield  consist  of  metamorphosed  Birimian  volcano- sedimentary  and  sedimentary  sequences  that  were  deposited  in  a  shallow  marine  continental shelf at a delta front setting. These sequences have been intruded by plutonic  rocks  that  include  granodiorite-tonalite,  pyroxenite-gabbro,  granite  (adamellite)  plutons  and dolerite dykes. The plutons and dyke systems have contact metamorphosed the rocks  of  the  region  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies,  but  primary  sedimentary  structures  are  preserved as compositional layers. All the lithologies in the area have been subjected to  several phases of local-regional deformation, with development of mylonite, schistosity,  and L-tectonite. Two phases of deformation are recognised related to the Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ) in  the  area. || However most of the published ages in Figure 22 imply syn-depositional emplacement. (3) In Figure 22 the ages for granite suite rocks are younger than, or, synchronous to, the  emplacement of tonalite suite rocks. At Essakane goldfield granite xenoliths are hosted in  tonalite, which means that the granite suite is older than the tonalite suite. Consequently the data set shows inconsistencies and this needs further investigation. 46 || However, little or  no research has been undertaken to develop an understanding of first order crustal scale  structures and their relationship to gold mineralization in the Essakane goldfield. This is  the purpose of this report. || The  pegmatite  vein  is  ±40  cm  thick,  and  it  trends  NE. It  is  a  plagioclase-tourmaline-topaz  pegmatite with crystals greater than 10cm in size. 4.7.4 Dolerite  A series of parallel NW-trending, mafic magnetic dolerite dykes crosscut the study area. They are composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and magnetite and  commonly  exhibit  granophyric texture in thin section. The mineralogical composition is given in Figure 10. The  dykes  crosscut  greywacke-siltstone  sequences  at  the  Essakane  goldfield  and  have  contact  metamorphosed  these  sequences  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies. || The early phase of D2 is associated with medium to high grade metamorphic conditions  with  high  strain  along  the  MSZ  and  formation  of  the  MMZ  and  pseudotachylyte  veins  (Fig. 2). Quartz  iron-rich  cataclasite  veins  and  buck  quartz-carbonate  (±  tourmaline)  veins  in  quartz-chlorite  shears  crosscut  the  MMZ  and  are  interpreted  to  represent  low  strain rates during progressive deformation on the MSZ. Quartz-chlorite shear zones are  gold bearing at Essakane goldfield. 6.5 Relative and Absolute chronologies (Tectonic history)  Although  absolute  dating  can  delineate  separate  stratigraphic  sequences  and  tectonic  events based on heavy or light mineral analysis, these minerals are rarely available and  the analyses are limited by availability of resources. Due to geological processes that are  continuously  taking  place,  including,  erosion,  deposition  and  tectonic  events,  complete  stratigraphic  sequences  are  rarely  available  to  define  absolute  ages,  and  therefore,  it  is  generally  simple  to  establish  the  spatial  and  temporal  relationship  of  the  various  geological  features  in  the  region  by  establishing  the  crosscutting  relationships. || The gold mineralization in the Essakane goldfield is related to the  late quartz-chlorite schist of D2. 48 || However most of the published ages in Figure 22 imply syn-depositional emplacement. (3) In Figure 22 the ages for granite suite rocks are younger than, or, synchronous to, the  emplacement of tonalite suite rocks. At Essakane goldfield granite xenoliths are hosted in  tonalite, which means that the granite suite is older than the tonalite suite.

(1996)  interpreted that the Markoye fault formed during the Eburnean Orogeny at 2150 to 2095  Ma. However  little  field  data  has  been  presented  to  quantify  the  tectonic  history  of  the  structure and thus tectonic interpretation are contradictory. The  focus  of  this  research  is  the  Markoye  fault  and  its  tectonic  history. Added  to  this,  field studies test the possibility that the Markoye fault is a Pan African structure and that  gold  metallogenesis  is  associated  with  late  Neo-Proterozoic  Pan  African  tectonics  (c.f. Liégeois  et  al.,  2003)  through  development  of  a  relative  chronology  of  structural  and  metallogenic events. || Chapter 3: Methodology  3.1 Data collection  In  January  2007  a  detailed  structural  mapping  project  was  conducted  in  the  study  area  over  a  period  of  20  days,  including  days  allocated  to  logistics  and  camp  management. Geology  and  topographic  maps,  and  airborne  magnetic  data  were  used  to  delineate  the  Markoye  fault. Geographic  and  geologic  reconnaissance  studies  of  the  region  were  conducted  before  the  actual  field  work  commenced. Several  east-west  traverses  were  conducted  across  the  Markoye  fault  between  Essakane  and  Tambăo  (Fig.1  and  2). For  each station point mapped, lithological and structural data was recorded, a photographic  record was made, GPS position was established using UTM grid co-ordinates (WGS 84),  and if appropriate, samples were collected for petrographic studies. The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the  geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  Garmin  Geographic  Positioning  System  (GPS) instrument. || Chapter 5: Structure  5.1 Preamble  The Markoye fault is ~5 km wide and is NE-trending. It is a composite structure of faults,  shears,  L-tectonites,  zones  of  mylonitisation  and  pseudotachylyte  veins. It  hosts  an  en  echelon  buck  quartz-carbonate  vein  array. The  structure  has  undergone  two  phases  of  brittle-ductile  deformation  and  at  least  two  phases  of  reactivation  are  recognised. D1  resulted in the development of the NW-trending asymmetric fold (F1), and the sense of  displacement on the Markoye fault was dextral (reverse). D2 marked a period of sinistral  (reverse)  displacement  on  the  Markoye  fault  with  refolding  of  F1  to  form  NE-trending  folds (F2). || Chapter 7: Conclusion  The Markoye fault is a broad zone of faulting, shearing, mylonite zone, pseudotachylyte  veins, L-tectonites, quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins and quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline)  veins and is renamed as the Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ). The  lithologies  of  Essakane  goldfield  consist  of  metamorphosed  Birimian  volcano- sedimentary  and  sedimentary  sequences  that  were  deposited  in  a  shallow  marine  continental shelf at a delta front setting. These sequences have been intruded by plutonic  rocks  that  include  granodiorite-tonalite,  pyroxenite-gabbro,  granite  (adamellite)  plutons  and dolerite dykes. The plutons and dyke systems have contact metamorphosed the rocks  of  the  region  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies,  but  primary  sedimentary  structures  are  preserved as compositional layers. All the lithologies in the area have been subjected to  several phases of local-regional deformation, with development of mylonite, schistosity,  and L-tectonite. Two phases of deformation are recognised related to the Markoye Shear Zone (MSZ) in  the  area. || F1 and F2 are crosscut by faults and quartz-chlorite shears associated with the  development of quartz-carbonate veins during reactivation of the Markoye fault. 5.2 D1  D1 is associated with the formation of NW-trending folds (F1) that are clearly evident in  the exploration trenches at Essakane Orpaillage (Fig. 11). An equal area projection of the  poles to bedding exposed in the trenches in the southern part of the Essakane Orpaillage  is  presented  in  Figure  12. The  mean  strike  and  dip  is  343°/27°E. Calculated  fold  axes  plunge  2°  towards  348°. || Figure  18. (a,  b,  c)  Quartz  iron-rich  cataclasite  veins  in  the  Markoye  fault.

(1989,  1991,  1992)  and  Hottin  and  Ouedraogo  (1992),  the  Markoye  fault  is  recorded  as  a  westerly-dipping  thrust  but  field  data was not presented. Unpublished structural studies completed for Goldfields Mining  Pty, Ltd, Ore Zone Resources and BHP Billiton concluded that the Markoye fault is an  east-verging  thrust  (Rogers  and  Dong,  2000)  and  that  it  is  a  part  of  a  regional  dextral  strike-slip system. 2.9 Regional metallogeny  The West African Craton hosts many mineral deposits, for example, gold, diamond, iron,  and  manganese,  silver,  lead  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). Several  deposits and deposit styles occur in the study area including; (1) The manganese deposit  at  Tambăo  close  to  border  with  Niger  (Fig. 2),  (2)  gold  mineralization  at  Essakane,  Gosséy, Koiréziéna, Falagountou (Fig. || It is medium to  coarse,  and  composed  of  millimetre-sized  crystals  of  potassium  feldspar,  quartz,  plagioclase, biotite and hornblende in a quartz-feldspar rich groundmass (Fig. 6, a, b and  c). Adjacent to the Markoye fault the granite is foliated and lineated. 4.7.2 Yacouba Mafic Complex (YMC)  The YMC is located NE of the Gosséy orpaillage (Fig. 2). It is composed of pyroxenite  and gabbro layers. || Structural  studies  indicate  that  the  NE-trending  Markoye  fault,  which  is  the  first-order  crustal-scale  structure,  have  undergone  at  least  two  phases  of  deformation,  D1  and  D2,  with reactivation during the late phase of D2. D1 resulted in formation of NW-trending  asymmetric folds and thrusts at Essakane, and the displacement along the Markoye fault  was dextral reverse. D2 is a period of SE-NW crustal shortening that formed NE-trending  folds,  and  NE-trending  regional  foliation. The  NE-trending  mylonite  to  ultramylonite  zone, pseudotachylyte veins, buck quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline) veins and quartz iron- rich catalasite vein, and late quartz-chlorite shears formed during D2. D1 is interpreted to pre-date the Eburnean Orogeny, and D2 is correlated to the Eburnean  Orogeny ~2.1 G.a. The name ‘Markoye Fault’ should be changed to Markoye Shear Zone  (MSZ) to reflect the complex nature of the structure and tectonic history. || The pseudotachylyte veins are interpreted  to have formed during high strain conditions, the resulting frictional heat melting the host  rock (Davis and Reynolds, 1996). Quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins (Fig. 18, a, b, c) outcrops west of the Yacouba Mafic  Complex  (YMC)  (Fig.2). The  cataclasite  veins  trends  067º  and  crosscut  the  YMC. The  cataclasite veins are interpreted to have formed during local dilation of the Markoye fault. Quartz-chlorite  shear  crosscut  the  cataclasite  and  the  YMC  as  well  indicating  that  the  quartz-chlorite shears are younger than the YMC and the cataclasite. || The quartz-chlorite shears are NE-trending. The schitosity measurements are represented  in  Figure  21. Schistosity  crosscuts  the  YMC  and  MMZ. The  anastomosing  cleavage  is  developed at the edge of YMC. 5.4 Relative chronology of structural events  - Formation of NW-trending folds (F1) and thrusts during SW-directed compression with  dextral reverse movement on the Markoye fault. -  Formation  of  NE-trending  folds  (F2)  during  SE-NW  compression  with  sinistral  (reverse) displacement on the Markoye fault with development of mylonite zone (MMZ)  and pseudotachylyte veins and quartz iron-rich cataclasite veins. || Structural  studies  indicate  that  the  NE-trending  Markoye  fault,  which  is  the  first-order  crustal-scale  structure,  have  undergone  at  least  two  phases  of  deformation,  D1  and  D2,  with reactivation during the late phase of D2.

(1991, 1992) and Feybesse  and  Milési  (1994)  considered  B1  to  be  younger  than  B2. In  contrast  Hein  et  al. (2004)  established  that  meta-volcanic  and  meta-pyroclastic  units  are  interbedded  with  meta- sedimentary rocks throughout the type locality in the Goren Greenstone Belt, and thus the  stratigraphy of the NE of Burkina Faso may need revision. 2.4 Intrusive complexes  During  the  polycyclic  Eburnean  Orogeny  numerous  calc-alkaline  plutons  intruded  the  Palaeoproterozoic sequences (Pawlig et al., 2006) including tonalite (TTG), granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite,  and  these  are  collectively  called  Eburnean  granitoids  (Pons  et  5 || (1996), but the stratigraphic order  was not defined. The three main units include: (1) a meta-pelite unit, (2) meta-sandstone  unit  and  (3)  a  meta-conglomerate  unit  containing  angular  clasts  of  quartzitic  and  micaceous lithic fragments of rhyolite, chert and schist. 2.7 Structure   Several regional tectono-metamorphic events are recognised in the NE of Burkina Faso. In  studies  conducted  by  Feybesse  et  al. (1990),  Lompo  et  al. (1991),  and  Hein  et  al. || 2.8 Markoye Fault  The first-order crustal-scale Markoye fault is located in the NE of Burkina Faso, west of  the  international  border  intersection  of  Burkina  Faso,  Mali  and  Niger  (Fig.1). The  fault  trends NE and is clearly visible in LANDSAT imagery (Fig. 2) and RTP magnetic data. According to Milési et al. (1989, 1992) and Castaing et al. (2003) the Markoye fault is  the  boundary  that  separates  Eburnean  granitoids  to  the  west  from  the  Tarkwa  Group  meta-sedimentary  units  in  the  east. || A granite suite which is localized along shear zones, intrudes both the  Birimian and the TTG suite and was emplaced between 2150 and 2130 Ma (Castaing et  al., 2003). Gabbro, meta-gabbro, diorite and trondhjemite intrusions are syn-tectonic with  emplacement of Birimian meta-volcanic sequences (Béziat et al., 2000; Hein et al., 2004)  and co-magmatic (Béziat et al., 2000). NE-trending dolerite dykes crosscut all Birimian,  Tarkwa and intrusive complexes in the NE of Burkina Faso and are dated at 250±13 Ma  (K-Ar whole rock dating) (Hottin and Ouedraogo, 1992). 2.5 Metamorphism  The Birimian sequences were metamorphosed during the Eburnean Orogeny with further  metamorphism  related  to  intrusion  of  granitoids. Metamorphic  grade  is  to  greenschist  facies  (Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1991;  Bossière  et  al.,  1996;  Hirdes  et  al.,  1996),  with  formation of chlorite and muscovite dominant mineral assemblages, and low to medium  grade amphibolite facies, with hornblende and andalusite dominant mineral assemblages  (Bossière  et  al.,  1996;  Béziat  et  al.,  2000;  Naba  et  al.,  2004)  particularly  in  the  contact  aureole  of  granitoids  (Pawlig  et  al.,  2006). The  Tarkwa  Group  is  metamorphosed  to  greenschist facies with development of chlorite and sericite (Milési et al., 1989, 1991). || The Baoule- Mossi domain is Palaeoproterozoic in age and consists of Birimian sequences that where  accreted  at  around  2100  Ma  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Milési  et  al.,  1991,  1992;  Boher  et  al.,  1992). The  syn-tectonic  emplacement  of  granitoids  during  accretion  occurred  at  around  2190-2108  Ma  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002). The  Tarkwa  Group  which  unconformably  overlies  the  Birimian  sequences  is  regarded  by  some  as  the  erosional  product  of  the  Birimian  sequences  and  granitoids  (Hastings, 1982; Leube et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1992; Castaing et al., 2003). 2.2 Stratigraphy  The area of study is situated in the NE of Burkina Faso. The overall stratigraphy of the  eastern part of Burkina Faso is established by the Palaeoproterozoic basement. The NE- trending  Birimian  meta-sedimentary  and  meta-volcanic  sequences  (2238-2170  Ma)  unconformably  overlie  the  basement.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 10,11,12,13,14<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Bossière  et  al. (1996)  concluded  that  the  Tarkwa  Group  meta-sedimentary  units  in  the  study area have no economic value. 9 || Chapter 3: Methodology  3.1 Data collection  In  January  2007  a  detailed  structural  mapping  project  was  conducted  in  the  study  area  over  a  period  of  20  days,  including  days  allocated  to  logistics  and  camp  management. Geology  and  topographic  maps,  and  airborne  magnetic  data  were  used  to  delineate  the  Markoye  fault. Geographic  and  geologic  reconnaissance  studies  of  the  region  were  conducted  before  the  actual  field  work  commenced. Several  east-west  traverses  were  conducted  across  the  Markoye  fault  between  Essakane  and  Tambăo  (Fig.1  and  2). For  each station point mapped, lithological and structural data was recorded, a photographic  record was made, GPS position was established using UTM grid co-ordinates (WGS 84),  and if appropriate, samples were collected for petrographic studies. The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the  geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  Garmin  Geographic  Positioning  System  (GPS) instrument. || In  Milési  et  al. (1989,  1991,  1992)  and  Hottin  and  Ouedraogo  (1992),  the  Markoye  fault  is  recorded  as  a  westerly-dipping  thrust  but  field  data was not presented. Unpublished structural studies completed for Goldfields Mining  Pty, Ltd, Ore Zone Resources and BHP Billiton concluded that the Markoye fault is an  east-verging  thrust  (Rogers  and  Dong,  2000)  and  that  it  is  a  part  of  a  regional  dextral  strike-slip system. 2.9 Regional metallogeny  The West African Craton hosts many mineral deposits, for example, gold, diamond, iron,  and  manganese,  silver,  lead  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). Several  deposits and deposit styles occur in the study area including; (1) The manganese deposit  at  Tambăo  close  to  border  with  Niger  (Fig. 2),  (2)  gold  mineralization  at  Essakane,  Gosséy, Koiréziéna, Falagountou (Fig. || is  crosscut  by  a  week  anastomosing  cleavage  that  is  non  penetrative.

The  wall  rocks  to  these  dykes  are  contact  metamorphosed  to  hornblende- hornfels facies. 4.7.3 Granodiorite-Tonalite  A granodiorite-tonalite intrusion outcrops over greater than 50% of the study area west of  the Markoye fault between Gosséy and Tambão (Fig. 1).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Tambao, Markoye, Oudalan, Sahel, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 14,15,17,22<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  sequences  are  dominated  by  meta-volcanoclastic  greywackes,  intercalated  meta- conglomerate,  meta-sandstone-greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale. The  sequences  have  primary sedimentary structures preserved as compositional layering. The  depositional  environment  of  the  sequences  is  interpreted  to  have  occurred  in  a  shallow  marine  continental  shelf  environment  at  a  delta  front  setting. The  sequences  where  subjected  to  several  phases  of  deformation  and  metamorphism. They  have  been  contact metamorphosed to hornblende hornfels facies during emplacement of adamellite,  pyroxenite-gabbro, granodiorite-tonalite plutons, and dolerite dykes. || Chapter 1: Introduction  1.1 Preamble  The  NE-trending  Markoye  fault  in  Burkina  Faso  is  a  first-order  crustal  scale  structure  located in the north-eastern part of Burkina Faso, between the towns of Dori and Tambão  by the boarder with Mali and Niger (Fig. 1). The structure has been interpreted as a major  westerly-dipping  thrust  (Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Hottin  and  Ouedraogo,  1992). Delfour  and  Jeabrum (1970) in Rogers and Dong (2000) defined the structure as an east-verging thrust  and  BHP  geologists  interpreted  the  structure  as  part  of  a  regional  dextral  strike-slip  system. Castaing  et  al. (2003)  interpreted  the  same  structure  as  a  sinistral  fault  system,  and  Milési  et  al.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 6,7<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
