The Loulo goldfield, SSE of Sadiola, is characterised by gold mineralisation  which is hosted in the Kofi Formation in tourmaline-rich quartz veins (Wilson, 2002). The Loulo deposit  is associated with earlier extensional veins and occurs mainly in the Lower Birimian sequence (Fouillac et  al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). In Ghana, gold mineralisation occurs in conglomerate beds in the Tarkwa  District (Milési et al., 1992).

In  the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are  gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite- pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold  systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008)  with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation.

In 2006, the country’s GDP was estimated at $5.847 billion with an annual growth rate estimated at 5.1%. The  country’s  GDP  puts  Mali  as  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world. The  main  sectors  that  contribute largely to this GDP are mining, agriculture and livestock farming and Mali is currently the 3rd  largest  producer  of  gold  in  the  continent  after  the  Republic  of  South  Africa  and  Ghana. Mining  is  a  growing industry in the country and gold mining accounts for approximately 80% of the mining activity.

The  Sadiola  open  cast  occurs  with  the  FE3  and  FE4  open  cast  within  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments  which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism  reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral  assemblages. The Sadiola deposit is hosted by the Kofi Formation which is currently undated. The Kofi  Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale  with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates. || CHAPTER 6: Conclusion  •  The mineral assemblages of the Sadiola open cast are representative of greenschist metamorphic  facies. •  Sadiola lithologies underwent at least two deformation events: one associated with the Tangaean  event (D1) and the latter associated with the Eburnean orogeny (D2). •  The  quartz  veins  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  in  the  D1  event  during  a  NE-directed  compression. •  Sadiola  lithologies  underwent  two  metamorphic  events:  regional  metamorphism  to  lower  greenschist facies and contact metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies. •  Gold  mineralisation  is  associated  with  a  variety  of  alteration  system  with  pyrite-arsenopyrite  mineral assemblage. •  Mineralisation  tends  to  occur  along  the  carbonate-greywacke  contact  which  is  from  the  inner  contact aureole to the middle aureole. || Metamorphism at Sadiola reached hornblende-hornfels facies as a result of  the emplacement of tonalite-granodiorite plutons and the tonalite dykes  (Hein and Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). 3.4 Gold Mineralisation  Three  types  of  gold  mineralisation  have  been  recognised  in  the  West  African  Craton. These  are  pre- orogenic,  syn-orogenic  and  late-orogenic  mineralisation. Mineralisation  is  related  to  regional  tectonic  event (Milesi et al, 1992; Beziat et al., 2008). Pre-orogenic deposits are associated with early extensional  zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991;  Fouillac et al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). Syn-orogenic mineralisation is associated with mineralisation in  disseminated  sulphides  in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rock  (Milési  et  al.,  1992). || Mineralisation  at  Sadiola  has  been  shown  to  have  a  temporal  and  a  spatial  relationship to the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and tonalite dykes. Sadiola is located in close proximity to  the  Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian  plutonic  system. Mineralisation  has  shown  to  be  as  a  result  of  the  fluids and metamorphism associated with the intrusions (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Determining the  paragenesis,  investigation  of  the  mineralogical,  microstructural  and  alteration  events  will  assist  in  determining  gold  mineralisation,  and  is  considered  important  for  the  Sadiola  exploration  and  in-mine  development. 1.2  Location and Physiography  The  Sadiola  opencast  mine  is  located  within  the  Sadiola  village. The  village  is  situated  in  the  south- western part of Mali at about 77km south of the regional capital, Kayes (Fig. || The alteration types recorded in the host rocks are potassic, silicification, dolomitisation, chlorite-biotite  alteration,  calc-silicate  and  sulphidation. The  common  sulphide  minerals  are  pyrite,  arsenopyrite  and  pyrrhotite  with minor  magnetite and sphalerite. The following paragenetic sequence is observed for the  ore  mineralogy:  pyrite  –  chalcopyrite  -  (+  sphalerite)  –  arsenopyrite. Gold is  paragenetically  associated  with pyrite and arsenopyrite. The rocks also show evidence of deformation through kinked biotite and the  development  of stylolites. Two metamorphic events are recorded at Sadiola: regional metamorphism to  greenschist facies and contact metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies. || intrusions. The mineralisation at Sadiola  is therefore interpreted to be as a result of metamorphism and  deformation  brought  about  the  Sekokoto  pluton  emplacement  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny. Structural  data  indicate  that  quartz  veins  formed  prior  to  the  development  of  the  S2  cleavage  systems.

Jordaan et al. (1994) indicated that calcitic marbles occur in the Kofi  Formation. The Sadiola goldfield consists of greywacke, siltstone, marble, carbonaceous to volcanoclastic  greywacke  and  BIF  shale  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). The  goldfield  occurs  along  a  marble- greywacke contact located east of the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (Hanssen et al., 1998). The greywacke units of the Sadiola goldfield are best developed to the west of the Sadiola Fracture Zone,  while impure carbonates are best developed to the east. || 4.3 Structure  Two  deformation  events  are  recorded  for  the  study  areas  in  the  Sadiola  deposit. These  are  interpreted  from  equal  area  stereographic  projections  of  bedding  and  the  discontinuous,  parallel  cleavage  in  the  metasedimentary  rocks. The  equal  area  stereographic  projections  of  bedding  from  the  Helicopter  Pit  records  a  calculated  mean  bedding  of  336o/64oE  with  a  calculated  mean  for  the  west  high-wall  of  350o/51oW. The  spread  of  the  data  around  the  primitive  circles  is  related  to  folding  about  a  NNW- trending  fold  axes  (F1)  and  refolding  of  F1  about  the  ENE-ESE  trending  fold  axes  (F2). Bedding  is  rotated against minor faults (Fig. 6). || Sadiola deposit is therefore classified as either an intrusion-related gold deposit or a thermal aureole gold  deposit,  which  are  all  subclasses  of  orogenic  gold  deposits. Mineralisation  at  the  Sadiola  deposit  is  spatially and temporally associated with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and tonalite dykes. The Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  served  as  the  fluid  conduit  and  mineralisation  occurs  along  the  inner  to  middle  contact  aureole. The ubiquitous occurrence of biotite marker in polished thin sections is interpreted as indicating  biotite isograd and marks the division between rocks that have been completely recrystallised at Sadiola  to rocks in which the primary bedding is still preserved. vi || The Sadiola Fracture Zone is interpreted to be a  splay  of  the  Senegalo-Malian  Shear  Zone. Carbonate  units  are  the  main  host  to  the  Sadiola  deposit  (Boshoff  et  al.,  1998).

The  first  deformation  is  characterized  by  the  development  of  NNW-trending  folds  (F1). NNW  bedding  and  cleavage  (S1)  orientation associated with D1 are recorded in the study area. This deformation is termed the Tangaean  Event and formed during the NE-SW shortening period. Quartz veins formed during this event and their  dominant trend is towards NNE-NE. The second deformation event is characterized by the development of ENE-ESE trending folds (F2) and  NE-trending  cleavage  (S2). || 5.4 Comparison to Sadiola goldfield with the rest of the West African Gold deposits  The Sadiola deposits share some similarities with the other gold deposits in the West African Craton. In  the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are  gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite- pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold  systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008)  with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation. Two  styles  of  mineralisation  observed  in  Burkina  Faso  are  quartz-vein  and  disseminated  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008). || CHAPTER 1: Introduction  1.1  Preamble  The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou- Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3  and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société  d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the  government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast  commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit  styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit  (Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001). || Late-orogenic  deposits  are  characterised by disseminated gold-bearing arsenopyrite and Au-quartz lode and quartz-vein type. These  are interpreted as the major type and host of gold in West Africa (Milési et al., 1991).Two metallogenic  styles  have  been  observed  in  the  Sadiola  goldfield  by  Hein  and  Tshibubudze  (2007a,  b)  and  these  are  placer gold in the palaeochannels and screes and gold occurring in stockwork veins and breccias. 15 || Liégeois  et  al. (1991) concluded  that  metamorphism was  syn-tectonic  based  on the orientation  of  sheet  silicates  and  amphiboles. The  KKI  sediments  were  then  intruded  by  various  granitiod  plutons  which  caused further metamorphism (Dioh et al., 2006). The four types of granitoids that intruded the sediments  of  the  KKI  are  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids,  amphibole  bearing  granitoids,  pyroxene  and  K-bearing  granitoids  and  the  peraluminous  biotite  bearing  units  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). In  the  Sadiola  goldfield,  two  metamorphic  events  are  recorded:  regional  metamorphism  to  greenschist  facies  and  contact  metamorphism  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). Contact  metamorphism  is  defined  as  the  metamorphism that  occurs  in  close proximity  to  intrusions  and has  formed  as a  result  of  heat  from  the  intrusion (Blatt et al., 2006). || The Sadiola Fracture Zone is interpreted to be a  splay  of  the  Senegalo-Malian  Shear  Zone. Carbonate  units  are  the  main  host  to  the  Sadiola  deposit  (Boshoff  et  al.,  1998). The  lithologies  of  the  Sadiola  goldfield  show  evidence  of  macroscopic  to  mesoscopic  slump  structures  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b).The  slump  structures  in  the  Sadiola  goldfield  were  defined  by  Matabane  (2008)  in  the  FE3  open  casts,  but  occur  throughout  the  Sadiola  goldfield. There is  however  a  lack  of  detailed  stratigraphy  for  the Kofi  Formation  in  the  literature. Jordaan  et al. (1994)  outlined the  stratigraphy  of  the  Kofi  Formation:  the  formation  is  over  500m  in  thickness and  is  dominated at the base by arenitic tourmalinite, overlain by green argillite, interbedded pink arenite, calc- silicate, followed by the calcitic marble and pelite, which is locally dolomitised. || chemical  sediments  being  observed  throughout  the  belt. The  Main  Transcurrent  Zone  follows  the  lithological contact between the Mako and the Diale-Dalema Supergroups. *The  eastern  domain  hosts  the  Sadiola  goldfield  in  the  Kofi  Formaton  (Bishoff  et  al.,  1989;  Ranson,  1998; Wilson, 2002). This formation is also referred to as the Dalema-Kofi Supergroup and lies east of  the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone. The Kofi Formation is dominated by metasedimentary rocks (Ranson,  1998; Wilson, 2002). These rocks are classified as Biriman-type sediments and include greywacke, shale  and graphitic shale with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates (Hanssen et al.,  1978).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sadiola, Kayes Cercle, Kayes, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 12,15,16,31,33,8,15<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The goldfield also hosts the FE3  and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société  d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the  government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast  commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit  styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit  (Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sadiola, Kayes Cercle, Kayes, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 8<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

In  the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are  gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite- pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold  systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008)  with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation. Two  styles  of  mineralisation  observed  in  Burkina  Faso  are  quartz-vein  and  disseminated  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008). || CHAPTER 3: Regional Geology   3.1 The geology of the West African Craton and the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier  The West African Craton (Fig. 2) is a piece of continental crust that has been stable since approximately  1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997).

Sadiola is located in close proximity to  the  Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian  plutonic  system. Mineralisation  has  shown  to  be  as  a  result  of  the  fluids and metamorphism associated with the intrusions (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Determining the  paragenesis,  investigation  of  the  mineralogical,  microstructural  and  alteration  events  will  assist  in  determining  gold  mineralisation,  and  is  considered  important  for  the  Sadiola  exploration  and  in-mine  development. 1.2  Location and Physiography  The  Sadiola  opencast  mine  is  located  within  the  Sadiola  village. The  village  is  situated  in  the  south- western part of Mali at about 77km south of the regional capital, Kayes (Fig.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 8<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
