(2011)  argued  that  the  sedimentary  basins  in  western  Burkina  Faso  exhibited  complicated  strato-structural  relationships,  making it difficult to establish local stratigraphy. However, recent studies by WAXI (2013) concluded  that the stratigraphy of the WAC is dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of belts relative  to accretionary terranes. Importantly, a detailed stratigraphic study was conducted by Baratoux et al. (2011) across three  greenstone  belts  in  western  Burkina  Faso  (namely  the  Boromo,  Houndé  and  Banfora  belts)  (Figure  1.1). Their  study  confirmed  that  the  belts  are  composed  of  calc-alkaline  andesite  and  dacite,  intercalated  tuff  layers,  pyroclastic  flows,  Mn-Fe    rich  chert  layers  and  volcaniclastic  sedimentary  rocks  that  overlie  basal  units  of  tholeiitic basalt. || older  than  the  calc-alkaline  series  of  lavas  for  the  Boromo,  Houndé  and  Banfora  belts. However,  craton-wide studies by WAXI (2013) indicated that the stratigraphic order of volcanic rocks cannot be  generalised  (some  belts  do  not  host  tholeiitic  and/or  calc-alkaline  volcanic  rocks)  and  thus  the  stratigraphy of each greenstone belt must be established independently. 2.2. Granitoid and dolerite emplacement  The emplacement of tonalite-trondjemite-granodiorite (TTG) plutons and granites in the WAC  is restricted to 2200, 2160-2130 and 2100-2070 Ma according to Pawlig et al.

(2011)  argued  that  the  sedimentary  basins  in  western  Burkina  Faso  exhibited  complicated  strato-structural  relationships,  making it difficult to establish local stratigraphy. However, recent studies by WAXI (2013) concluded  that the stratigraphy of the WAC is dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of belts relative  to accretionary terranes. Importantly, a detailed stratigraphic study was conducted by Baratoux et al. (2011) across three  greenstone  belts  in  western  Burkina  Faso  (namely  the  Boromo,  Houndé  and  Banfora  belts)  (Figure  1.1). Their  study  confirmed  that  the  belts  are  composed  of  calc-alkaline  andesite  and  dacite,  intercalated  tuff  layers,  pyroclastic  flows,  Mn-Fe    rich  chert  layers  and  volcaniclastic  sedimentary  rocks  that  overlie  basal  units  of  tholeiitic basalt.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Banfora, Comoé, Waterfalls, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 22<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

INTRODUCTION  1.1. Preamble  Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed  of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary  rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite  (Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing  chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles,  1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in  Ghana  (Kitson,  1918)  and  were  classified  as  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  lavas.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Ghana<br><b>Pages:</b> 16<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

This  conclusion  was  established  from  Ti  and  LREE  depletions,  where  the  LREE  depletion  is  less  than  N-type  MORBs. It  was  suggested  that  an  intermediate  geochemistry  between  back-arc  basins  and  island-arc  tholeiites  made  such  an  environment an attractive setting, especially due to regionally low Nb concentrations (Zonou, 1987),  but  the  lack  of  ultramafic  rocks  (Burke,  1988)  and  unfitting  isotopic  and  trace  element  signatures  indicated an oceanic plateau origin (Abouchami et al., 1990). The distinction between the GB basalt samples forming in an arc-related basin compared to an  oceanic plateau setting is in their strato-tectonic context.

Location and physiography  Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger  and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the  Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average  daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and  northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || 1.4.

Thesis Organisation  This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:-  (1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related  ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || 1.6. Limitations of the study  A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political  instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were  restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against  unnecessary  travel. The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area. However,  a  comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano- sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study. 21 || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal  activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993;  Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to  classify the samples in order to characterize the tectonic setting for volcanic rocks of the GB. Geochemical data for volcanic rocks from the Boromo and Houndé belts, Oudalan-Gorouol belt  and Tiebélé belt  were used in a comparative study of volcanic units across several different belts in  Burkina Faso. Data from Baratoux et al. (2011) include 7 tholeiitic basalt samples and 6 calc-alkaline  volcanic samples that were reported for the Boromo and Houndé belts in western Burkina Faso. Data  from Ilboudo (2010) were reported for the Tiebélé region in the south of the country. Tshibubudze and  Hein  (2013)  reported  data  for  two  meta-volcanic  samples  (major-elements  only)  from  the  Oudalan- Gorouol belt (OGB) in the northeast of Burkina Faso. || Figure  1.1.

The Perkoa and Gaoua deposits are located in the Boromo belt in Burkina  Faso, southwest of Ouagadougou. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG  granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the  Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in  West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994;  Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba  et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup  (2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids  (2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in  the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian  Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely  the wet and dry seasons. The dry season occurs from October to May, which is followed by the wet  season from June until September (Bierschenk, 1968; McFarland et al., 1998). Geographically,  the  capital  city  of  Ouagadougou  is  situated  at  the  centre  of  the  country. The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  located  in  the  Sanmatenga  district. The  belt  is  elongate  and  northwest-trending and extends from the towns of Kaya to Kongossi (Figure 1.1). The town of Kaya is  approximately 90 km northeast of Ouagadougou and lies at the southeastern end of the belt. || 1.6. Limitations of the study  A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political  instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were  restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against  unnecessary  travel.

Despite  these  investigations,  surprisingly  little  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  volcanic  sequences  at  the  scale  of  one  or  several  belts  in  West  Africa. Few  studies  have  been  conducted  on  volcanic facies and metal potential in terms of base metals and Mn mineralisation, but delineating the  volcanic facies and alteration zones  of volcanic belts can help in identifying and targeting volcanic- related mineral deposits. For example, the Mount Reid volcanics in western Tasmania and the Abitibi  greenstone  belt  of  central  Canada  are  both  regions  where  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide  mineralization  has  been  found. Their  volcanic  facies  and  alteration  zones  are  well  understood,  providing spatial constraints to economic mineralization (McPhie et al., 1993; Piché and Jébrak 2006). Delineating facies is also important in developing tectonic models for volcanic terranes. || including  Finland,  Australia,  Mid-West  United  States  and  Canada  (Stern  et  al.,  1995;  Hill  and  Bickford, 2001; Väisänen and Westerlund, 2007; Li et al., 2013). The volcanic facies are similar due  to  analogous  depositional  environments,  many  of  which  are  mineralised  in  volcanogenic  massive  sulphides. 83<br><b>Geocode:</b> Canada<br><b>Pages:</b> 18,83<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Location and physiography  Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger  and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the  Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average  daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and  northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal  activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993;  Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || Vidal and Alric (1994)  interpreted that the basaltic sequences were the product of back-arc basin volcanism. Pouclet et al. (1996) and Hirdes et al. (1996) described two major periods of volcanism for the  WAC from two discrete but juxtaposed volcano-(sedimentary) belts in northeast Cote d’Ivoire;   (1)  an  eastern  belt  is  composed  of  basaltic  and  pyroclastic-dominated  volcanic  rocks  that  were  emplaced  at  approximately  2185-2150  Ma  (U-Pb  zircon). The  volcanic  rocks  are  widespread  in  Ghana, eastern Cote d’Ivoire and eastern Burkina Faso (WAXI, 2013). 16 || LIST OF FIGURES  Figure  1.1.

ROCK TYPES OF THE GOREN BELT  4.1. Introduction  The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are  intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia. These rocks were intruded  by  TTG  suite  plutons  including  the  Pissila  Batholith  and  the  Loudo  granodiorite  (Figure  2.1),  and  pyroxenite,  dolerite  and  aplite  dykes. The  basalt,  sedimentary  rocks  and  pyroclastic  breccias  are  metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  (Kříbek  et  al.,  2008),  or  middle  greenschist  facies  (Hein  et  al.,  2004), with amphibolite facies adjacent to plutons and dykes. This research was focused in areas of the  southern GB, where primary volcanic and sedimentary textures were only affected by sub-greenschist  and lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism. || 5. PETROGRAPHIC  OBSERVATIONS  OF  SELECTED  SAMPLES  FROM  THE  GOREN BELT  5.1. Basaltic rocks  A  petrographic  study  of  28  basalt  samples  was  completed  at  the  University  of  the  Witwatersrand Johannesburg. The  petrography  shows  that  the  basaltic  rocks  are  dominantly  aphyric  and  compositionally  similar. The  primary  mineralogy  of  the  samples  is  composed  of  clinopyroxene  and  plagioclase. Plagioclase  and  clinopyroxene  made  up  between  5  and  15  %  of  the  samples  as  variably altered microlites (Figure 5.1a).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Eco Belt Paints, Wadi Shahrour - Houmal Road, Kasarjian, Mirdasha, Merdashe, Baabda District, Mount Lebanon Governorate, 1003, Lebanon<br><b>Pages:</b> 35,45<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Thesis Organisation  This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:-  (1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related  ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || Figure  2.1. The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  presented  showing  the  locations  of  Kaya,  Mané,  Guilla,  Korsimoro,  Sirgui artisanal mine and Tangapella hill. Northwest and northeast trending shears and thrusts are represented as well as  WNW  trending  shears  of  the  Wabo-Tampelse  Event. A  variety  of  granodiorite  intrusions  are  shown  including  the  Pissila  batholith and Loudo granodiorite that crop out to the east of the Goren belt. The Silimidougou megacrystic granite crops out  to the west of the Goren belt.

The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the  Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The  Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt. Figure 2.1. The Goren volcano-sedimentary belt is presented showing the locations of Kaya, Mané,  Guilla, Korsimoro, Sirgui artisanal mine and Tangapella hill. Northwest and northeast trending  shears  and  thrusts  are  represented  as  well  as  WNW  trending  shears  of  the  Wabo-Tampelse  Event. || The volcanic facies were  established through field and petrographic interpretations. The subaqueous facies architecture consists  of proximal, coherent and autoclastic basaltic flow units containing porphyritic, aphyric, amygdaloidal  and hyaloclastic textures as well as pillowed, jointed and flow-banded basaltic lithofacies. Proximal to  distal volcanogenic manganese deposits intercalated with basalt flows indicate a syn-volcanic genesis. A  discrete  pyroclastic  interbed  (~300  m  thick)  within  a  volcanogenic,  marginal  marine  to  offshore  greywacke succession occupies a distal facies relative to the volcanic source and indicates a bimodal  source of volcanism, i.e., mafic and intermediate. Volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  are  characterized  by  quartz-ankerite  stockwork  breccia,  a  braunite-ilmenite-magnetite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-(gold)  mineral  assemblage  and  increased  Ba  concentrations,  indicating  syn-volcanic  seafloor-related  hydrothermal  activity. The  Goren  volcano- sedimentary  belt  presents potential for  economic  mineralisation  in  volcanogenic  primary  manganese  and base metal deposits. || Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely  the wet and dry seasons. The dry season occurs from October to May, which is followed by the wet  season from June until September (Bierschenk, 1968; McFarland et al., 1998). Geographically,  the  capital  city  of  Ouagadougou  is  situated  at  the  centre  of  the  country. The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  located  in  the  Sanmatenga  district. The  belt  is  elongate  and  northwest-trending and extends from the towns of Kaya to Kongossi (Figure 1.1). The town of Kaya is  approximately 90 km northeast of Ouagadougou and lies at the southeastern end of the belt. || volcanic  VHMS  deposit  of  the  Tiebélé  Dome  in  the  south  of  Burkina  Faso  is  a  sphalerite  bearing,  zinc-rich exhalative deposit (Ilboudo, 2010). 2.5. The Goren volcano-sedimentary belt  The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  was  deposited  approximately  2400-2300  Ma  and  is  characterized  by  a  conformable  sequence  of  sedimentary  rocks,  interbedded  with  volcaniclastic  and  pyroclastic deposits. Intercalated with this succession are mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks (Hein et  al., 2004; Hein, 2010). The belt has subsequently been subjected to three deformation events as well as  intruded  by  various  intrusive  bodies  and is  metamorphosed to  sub-greenschist to  middle  greenschist  facies (Hein et al., 2004; Kříbek et al., 2008).

Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  common  in  the  southern  GB  (Section  4.3.5;  Hein  et  al.,  2004)  and,  in  fact,  throughout  the  WAC  (Section  1.1;  Blanchot  et  al.,  1972;  Béssoles,  1977; Wright, 1985; Neumann, 1988; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008; Beauvais  et al., 2008). They are also reported from a number of Palaeoproterozoic terranes in India (Roy, 1968;  1973,  1981;  Roy  and  Purkait,  1968),  Guyana  (Choubert,  1973)  and  South  Africa  (Gutzmer  and  Buekes, 1996; Eriksson et al., 1993; Beyeme Zogo, 2010).<br><b>Geocode:</b> India<br><b>Pages:</b> 75<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

ROCK TYPES OF THE GOREN BELT  4.1. Introduction  The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are  intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia.

Location and physiography  Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger  and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the  Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average  daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and  northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || 1.6. Limitations of the study  A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political  instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were  restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against  unnecessary  travel. The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area. However,  a  comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano- sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study. 21 || 2. REVIEW OF WEST AFRICAN GEOLOGY  2.1. Stratigraphy  The West African Craton (WAC) is made up of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks and is  divided  into  the  Reguibat  Rise  in  the  north  and  the  Leo-Man  Rise  in  the  south  (Thiéblemont  et  al.,  2004)  (Figure  1.1). The  Leo-Man  consists  of  two  domains,  namely  the  Archaean  Kénema-Man  domain  (3.54  Ga)  in  the  southwest  and the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (2.3-1.8  Ga)  in  the  east  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006),  with  the  exception  of  the  Kénieba-  Kédougou  and  Kayes  Inliers,  located  between  Mali  and  Senegal  (Figure  1.1). The  Birimian  Supergroup  makes  up  part  of  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  and  was  deposited  ca. 2.3  Ga  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006). || Three field seasons were planned for between January 2012 and December 2013; however, only  two  were  completed. The field  area  was  officially  declared  unsafe  in January  2013  because  of civil  war in the neighbouring country of Mali, and access to the GB was restricted to foreigners. Due to the  restricted access, a comparative study was undertaken using geochemical data by Ilboudo (2010) for  the Tiebélé Dome in southern Burkina Faso, and Baratoux et al. (2011) for the Boromo, Houndé and  Banfora belts, in order to investigate similarities and differences with the samples from the GB. The January 2012 field season was a reconnaissance season intended to gain insight into the size  of  the  field  area  and  ideal  locations  for  sampling. Limited  sampling  and  mapping  was  completed  during  this  time. || This  bimodal  volcanic  suite  was  also  described  by  Abouchami  et  al. (1990)  in  craton-wide  studies  that  concluded  that tholeiitic suites were more abundant than calc-alkaline suites (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher et  al., 1992; Pouclet et al., 1996; Arndt et al., 1997; Lompo, 2009). Mg-rich tholeiites and calc-alkaline  lavas  were  also  described  by  Dia  et  al. (1997)  from  the  Kénieba-Kédougou  Inlier  of  western  Mali. Blanchot et al.

For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well  preserved volcanic textures where the rocks are not strongly altered by hydrothermal processes and/or  deformed  (McPhie  and  Allen,  2003). An  example  of  this  is  the  devitrification  of  volcanic  glass,  as  described  by  McPhie  and  Allen  (op  cit.,  2003);  crystal  boundaries  remain  intact  and  the  glass  recrystallises as zeolites with a minor proportion of clay minerals. As a further example, metamorphosed Triassic basalt lavas in NW Croatia were interpreted as  proximal  to intermediate  facies  by  Palinkaš  et  al. (2008)  based  on  volcanic textures  such  as  closely  packed  pillows,  hyaloclastite,  pepperite  and  tortoise-shell  jointing.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Croatia, 12, Mühlenthal, Kommern, Mechernich, Kreis Euskirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, 53894, Germany<br><b>Pages:</b> 30<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Metallogenesis  Metallogenesis in the northeast of Burkina Faso includes gold, diamonds,  Mn-Fe, silver, lead,  molybdenum,  copper  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1992;  Hein  et  al.,  2004;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). In  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  belt,  manganese  deposits  occur  at  Tambão  and  Billiata  (Figure  1.1)  and  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  the  Tin  Edia  deposit. Gold  occurrences  include  commercially  mined  goldfields  such  as  Essakane,  Inata  and  Taparko  goldfields,  as  well  as  artisanally mined deposits such as Falagountou artisanal mine. They occur as shear and quartz vein- hosted deposits. Diamondiferous lamproite and lamprophyre plugs and dykes crop out NNW of Kaya  in the Pissila batholith in the Barsalogo diamond field, with rare kimberlite pipes (WAXI, 2013). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal  activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993;  Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || The Essakane, Falagountou, Taparko and Inata goldfields are represented in north-northeast of  Burkina Faso. The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of  the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt. 17<br><b>Geocode:</b> Tambao, Markoye, Oudalan, Sahel, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 17,24,76<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The Tambão deposit has an exploitable  reserve  of  15  Mt  of  manganese  ore  divided  between  primary  and  supergene  manganese  resources  (Colin et al., 2005). The  greywacke  units  of  the  GB  are  characterized  by  trough  cross  bedding,  upward-fining  sequences,  scour  and  fill,  thin  conglomerate  interbeds,  flame  structures,  chert  interbeds,  mud  clasts  and  mud  drapes  (Section  4.3.3)  which  indicates  that  deposition  took  place  in  a  marginal  marine  to  offshore  environment  (Fischer  and  Schmincke,  1994;  Boggs,  2006). The  greywacke  units  best  represent  a  prograding  delta  front  adjacent  to  a  shelf  margin. This  is  supported  by  fining  upwards  sequences interpreted to represent various incomplete, small-scale Bouma sequences (Bouma, 1962).

The samples range from 45.5 to 55.9 SiO2 (wt%) with  the lowest  SiO2  concentration  sampled  from  the  Tiebélé region  and  the  highest from  the  GB. Some  samples  from  Tiebélé  and Boromo-Houndé  belts  show  higher  Na2O+K2O  (wt%)  when  compared  to  the GB volcanics. The OGB samples show a relatively large difference in SiO2. Sample BF_1366, in  particular reported little Na2O+K2O (~ 0.2 wt %). The Boromo-Houndé volcanics plot on a trend from  basalt to andesite as the SiO2 and Na2O+K2O increased. || A  trend  from  MgO  toward FeOtotal was resolved for the Boromo-Houndé tholeiitic basalts, which plot in the tholeiite field. The  Tiebélé  samples  did  not  resolve  a  trend  possibly  due  to  the  limited  sample  suite  analysed  by  Ilboudo (2010). They were scattered throughout the calc-alkaline and tholeiitic fields. Harker  diagrams  were  plotted  for  samples  from  the  GB. They  are  summarized  according  to  trends  observed. MgO  was  used  on  the  x-axis  rather  than  SiO2  because  the  range  of  MgO  in  mafic  volcanic  rocks  is  much  less  than  SiO2,  avoiding  the  effect  of  distortion. || Another  possibility  for  such  anomalous  phosphorus  could  be  due  to  carbonate  alteration. Phosphate  bearing  minerals  such  as  apatite  do dissolve  readily  in  acidic fluids,  even with relatively weak acidity (Prof. G. Cawthorn, Pers. Comm.).

This  indicates  both  tholeiitic  and  calc-alkaline  compositions for all the samples plotted. The  samples  from  the  GB  were  plotted  on  an  AFM  diagram. AFM  diagrams  can  have  their  limitations, including their petrogenetic information. This is due to the components that make up the  trivariate diagram that collectively make up less than half of the potential chemical constituents of a  rock. In  addition,  because  data  are  normalised  to  100  %  in  order  to  plot  on  a  ternary  diagram,  distortions can occur to a certain degree (Rollinson, 1993). || Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts plot within  the Low-K series as well as the calc-alkaline fields (Medium-K, High-K series and the Shoshonite series.

The majority of the Tiebélé basalts exhibit REE concentrations more  than 10 times that of chondrite. Both negative and positive Eu anomalies occurr in the Tiebélé basalts,  which  contrasts  with  the  GB  tholeiitic  basalts. The  positive  anomalies  suggest  that  plagioclase  accumulated from the melt in high enough abundance to allow for positive Eu concentrations. || The Boromo-Houndé and Tiebélé basaltic rocks were also plotted in  Figure 6.1d.

The  calc-alkaline  rocks  present  enrichment  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE  compared  to  the  tholeiitic  compositions,  resulting  in  a  decreasing  trend. Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline volcanic rocks have La values range from ~30-80 time chondrite and Lu between ~6 and 12  times chondrite. Negative Eu anomalies are present. || The Tiebélé samples (HTPILL and HTBA),  which had been classified as basaltic rocks by Ilboudo (2010),show high Na2O+K2O values (up to ~6  and  10  wt%)  and  plot  as  tephrite/basanite  and  trachyandesite,  respectively. Sample  HTGOGO  from  the Tiebélé region, plots as an alkaline volcanic rock in the basalt field. The highest K2O+Na2O value  from  the  Tiebélé  samples  is  9.86  wt%. The  GB  samples  show  a  maximum  K2O+Na2O  value  of  4.7  wt%. A  further  sub-division  of sub-alkalic  rocks  is  shown using  SiO2  versus K2O  in wt% in  Figure  6.1d.

Rb  also  shows  low  values,  particularly  for  the  GB  and  Boromo-Houndé  samples. The Tiebélé basalt samples show low Rb values, but not as low as the other two sample regions. It is  unlikely that the negative Rb values are caused by distortion, as a result of its position on the x-axis  because it was plotted adjacent to Ba, which contains similar ionic properties. Thus Rb is probably low  due its mobility during alteration.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Tiébélé, Nahouri, Central-South, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 11,13,55,57,58,59,66,67,78<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting.

As  the MgO concentration began to decrease, the Na2O concentration rapidly increased.

They are also reported from a number of Palaeoproterozoic terranes in India (Roy, 1968;  1973,  1981;  Roy  and  Purkait,  1968),  Guyana  (Choubert,  1973)  and  South  Africa  (Gutzmer  and  Buekes, 1996; Eriksson et al., 1993; Beyeme Zogo, 2010).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Wan Chai, Hennessy Road, Wan Chai South, Wan Chai, Wan Chai District, Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong, China<br><b>Pages:</b> 75<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Location and physiography  Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger  and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the  Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average  daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and  northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || 1.4.

Thesis Organisation  This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:-  (1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related  ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG  granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the  Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in  West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994;  Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba  et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup  (2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids  (2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in  the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian  Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || Most importantly, I wish to thank WAXI (West African Exploration Initiative), the AMIRA and  its sponsors, without whom this research would not have been possible. I  wish  to  gratefully  acknowledge  AMIRA  International  and  the  industry  sponsors,  including  AusAid and the ARC Linkage Project LP110100667, for their support of the WAXI Project (P934A). I am also appreciative of the contribution of the various Geological Surveys/Department of Mines in  West Africa as sponsors in-kind of WAXI. Finally, I wish to recognize our WAXI research colleagues  from the various Institutions from around the world. I would like to thank the National Research Foundation for providing funding for this research  in 2012. 5<br><b>Geocode:</b> West Africa, Rue d'Auxonne, Faubourg Saint-Pierre, Université, Dijon, Côte-d'Or, Bourgogne – Franche-Comté, Metropolitan France, 21000, France<br><b>Pages:</b> 18,19,20,23,5<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

INTRODUCTION  1.1. Preamble  Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed  of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary  rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite  (Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing  chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles,  1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in  Ghana  (Kitson,  1918)  and  were  classified  as  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  lavas. || ABSTRACT  The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso  represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on  a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style  basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and  trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the  occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised  concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as  well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic  of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits,  siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed  of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Figure  1.1. Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern  Ghana. Volcano- sedimentary  belts  from  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso  are  modified after  Hein  et  al. (2004);  the  study  area  is  located  in  the  Goren belt and expanded in Inset A. Location of Tiebélé dome of southern Burkina Faso with Zn anomalies as defined by  Ilboudo  (2010)  is  presented  in  Inset  B. The  Perkoa  and  Gaoua  deposits  are  located  in  the  Boromo  belt  in  Burkina  Faso,  southwest of Ouagadougou. || LIST OF FIGURES  Figure  1.1. Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern  Ghana. Volcano-sedimentary belts from the northeast Burkina Faso are modified after Hein et  al. (2004);  the  study  area  is  located  in  the  Goren  belt  and  expanded  in  Inset  A. Location  of  Tiebélé  dome  of  southern  Burkina  Faso  with  Zn  anomalies  as  defined  by  Ilboudo  (2010)  is  presented in Inset B. The Perkoa and Gaoua deposits are located in the Boromo belt in Burkina  Faso, southwest of Ouagadougou. || Petrographically,  lithologically  and  geochemically,  back-arc  and/or  intra-arc  basin  basalts  settings are extremely difficult to distinguish, especially in ancient terranes  (Pearce, 1996;  Väisänen  and Westerlund, 2007). It was suggested by Pearce (1996) that back-arc and/or intra-arc basin basalts  should be referred to as transitional between back-arc basin basalts and intra-arc tholeiites (IAT) when  geochemical  evidence  cannot  ascertain  the  correct  tectonic  setting. This  has  been  that  rationale  adopted in this thesis. 7.3. The Goren belt in a regional context  In  northeast  Burkina  Faso,  geochemical  analyses  of  of  volcanic  rocks  from  various  belts,  including the Oudalan-Gorouol, Bouroum-Yalogo and Goren volcano-sedimentary belts suggest that  deposition of supracrustal rocks occurred in island arc terranes, followed by the accretion of multiple  arcs (WAXI,  2013). Vidal  et  al. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG  granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the  Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in  West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994;  Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba  et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup  (2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids  (2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in  the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian  Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || greenschist facies at most (WAXI, 2013). Regional metamorphism in the Eburnean Orogeny attained  greenschist  facies  (Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1991;  Bossière  et  al.,  1996;  Hirdes  et  al.,  1996)  with  the  development of chlorite, muscovite, epidote and actinolite mineral assemblages, and low to medium  grade amphibolite facies with the introduction of hornblende (Bossière et al., 1996; Béziat et al., 2000;  Debat et al., 2003; Naba et al., 2004). Granulite facies metamorphic rocks  crop out in the Oudalan- Gorouol belt on the margin of the Dori batholith in the Gorom Gorom region (Tshibubudze and Hein,  2013), and in the Pissila batholith in the Saaba region (Simoko, 2012). Three deformation events are recognised in northeast Burkina Faso:  (1)  D1  (Tangaean  Event)  resulted  in  NW-trending  dextral  reverse  shear  zones,  folds  and  an  S1  foliation. The  shortening  direction  was  SW-directed  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009;  Hein,  2010;  Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  2013). D1  is  recognised  in  northern  Ghana  by  de  Kock  et  al.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 16,17,23,24,3,8,81<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

ROCK TYPES OF THE GOREN BELT  4.1. Introduction  The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are  intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia. These rocks were intruded  by  TTG  suite  plutons  including  the  Pissila  Batholith  and  the  Loudo  granodiorite  (Figure  2.1),  and  pyroxenite,  dolerite  and  aplite  dykes. The  basalt,  sedimentary  rocks  and  pyroclastic  breccias  are  metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  (Kříbek  et  al.,  2008),  or  middle  greenschist  facies  (Hein  et  al.,  2004), with amphibolite facies adjacent to plutons and dykes. This research was focused in areas of the  southern GB, where primary volcanic and sedimentary textures were only affected by sub-greenschist  and lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism. || Another  possibility  for  such  anomalous  phosphorus  could  be  due  to  carbonate  alteration. Phosphate  bearing  minerals  such  as  apatite  do dissolve  readily  in  acidic fluids,  even with relatively weak acidity (Prof. G. Cawthorn, Pers. Comm.). The comparison between the tholeiitic basalts from the southern GB with those from the Tiebélé  and  Boromo-Houndé  belts,  and  calc-alkaline  mafic-intermediate  rocks  of  the  Boromo-Houndé  belts  78 || Figure 4.1. Photograph of plagioclase crystals in porphyritic basalt (rare) demonstrating preferential weathering. Crystals  measure 1.5 cm in length (Station point G12-02-098; UTM 30P 693240; 1443462). Hyaloclastic basalt breccias crop out throughout the southern GB as discrete units and as inter- pillow  detritus  in  pillowed  basalt  units. Commonly  pillow  basalt  grades  into  hyaloclastite  breccia  units. Breccia  fragments  are  surrounded  by  a  fine  crystalline  matrix  and/or  altered  volcanic  glass. || They  are  associated  with  low  discharge rates of magma and/or extrusion onto low gradient slopes (Griffiths and Fink, 1992). Pillow  lavas of the southern GB are interpreted to have formed in relatively shallow water, due to their high  vesicle abundance, and perhaps only a few hundred meters water depth (cf. Jones, 1969). The vesicles  indicate  movement  of  gas  toward  flow  boundaries,  particularly  the  top  of  flow  units;  for  example,  Archaean subaqueous basalts in Quebec were identified by Dimroth et al. (1978) with an abundance of  vesicles  positioned  towards  the  upper  margins  of  flow  units  and  less  abundant  in  the  flow/pillow  interior. However, the accumulation of vesicles is not unique to subaqueous flows. || the GB basalts could have extended into an intermediate facies, further away from the volcanic  vent  from which they were erupted. 7.1.2. Sedimentary rocks of the south Goren belt  Conformable  sedimentary  sequences  are  intercalated  with  basalt  flows  in  the  stratigraphic  sequence  of  the  southern  GB. These  include  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sediments,  siltstone,  volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit. Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  common  in  the  southern  GB  (Section  4.3.5;  Hein  et  al.,  2004)  and,  in  fact,  throughout  the  WAC  (Section  1.1;  Blanchot  et  al.,  1972;  Béssoles,  1977; Wright, 1985; Neumann, 1988; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008; Beauvais  et al., 2008). They are also reported from a number of Palaeoproterozoic terranes in India (Roy, 1968;  1973,  1981;  Roy  and  Purkait,  1968),  Guyana  (Choubert,  1973)  and  South  Africa  (Gutzmer  and  Buekes, 1996; Eriksson et al., 1993; Beyeme Zogo, 2010).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Southern, Station Cottages, Hassocks, Keymer, Mid Sussex, West Sussex, England, BN6 8JE, United Kingdom<br><b>Pages:</b> 35,36,72,75,78<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Introduction  The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are  intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia. These rocks were intruded  by  TTG  suite  plutons  including  the  Pissila  Batholith  and  the  Loudo  granodiorite  (Figure  2.1),  and  pyroxenite,  dolerite  and  aplite  dykes. The  basalt,  sedimentary  rocks  and  pyroclastic  breccias  are  metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  (Kříbek  et  al.,  2008),  or  middle  greenschist  facies  (Hein  et  al.,  2004), with amphibolite facies adjacent to plutons and dykes. This research was focused in areas of the  southern GB, where primary volcanic and sedimentary textures were only affected by sub-greenschist  and lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Eco Belt Paints, Wadi Shahrour - Houmal Road, Kasarjian, Mirdasha, Merdashe, Baabda District, Mount Lebanon Governorate, 1003, Lebanon<br><b>Pages:</b> 35<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Evidence is based on  a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style  basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and  trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the  occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised  concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as  well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic  of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits,  siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed  of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Distal  versus proximal facies and coherent versus volcaniclastic facies can be interpreted using lithological  relationships, volcanic textures and rock composition. For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano- sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with  Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were  leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and  concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative  processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the  same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be  juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology,  sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic  environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1)  where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are  intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe   bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010). || The belt is weakly to moderately metamorphosed, giving  a  unique  opportunity  to study  relatively  pristine  volcanic textures and  establish  volcanic  facies. The  volcano-sedimentary  units  have  been  mapped,  sampled  in  detail  and  analysed  both  petrographically  and  geochemically. From  field  studies,  geological  and  volcanic  facies  maps  were  created. This  information  has  been  used  to  interpret  volcanic  setting. The  metallogenic  potential  of  the  southern  Goren volcano-sedimentary belt has also been assessed in this study. 18<br><b>Geocode:</b> Goren, Maale Yosef Regional Council, Acre Subdistrict, North District, Israel<br><b>Pages:</b> 18,3<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
