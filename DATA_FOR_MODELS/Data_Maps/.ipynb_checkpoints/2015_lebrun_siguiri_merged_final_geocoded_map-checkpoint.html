Regionally  and  in  many  other  areas  of  the  Craton  (Ashanti,  Prestea,  Kalana;  Milési  et  al. 1992),  this  deformation  event  is  typically associated with the main phase of gold mineralization. However, this event does not  appear to be mineralized in the Siguiri district. Finally, Steyn (2012) recognized a last deformation event, termed D3, associated with  an E-W extension and which was not found to be mineralized in gold. This deformation event  was not recognized by the present study, Milési et al. || As an example, numerous orogenic gold deposits hosted in sedimentary basins around  the  world  are  interpreted  to  be  sitting  on  early  structures  highlighted  in  the  field  through  lithofacies  variations. For  example,  the  Kirkland  Lake  deposit  hosted  along  the  Kirkland-Lake  Cadillac fault that marks the unconformity between the Timiskaming sediments and the Abitibi  Supergroup  in  Canada  (Hyde,  1980). Similarly  in  the  Western  Australian  Yilgarn  craton,  gold  deposits such as Ant Hill, Bullant, Porphyry and Wattlebird are hosted along the Ballard-Zuleika  Shear Zone and highlighted by the Kurrawang Group sediments (Robert et al., 2005; Mueller et  al., 1996; Weinberg et al., n.d.). In the West African Craton, the giant Obuasi deposit in Ghana  is hosted along the  Ashanti fault separating the Birimian sediments from the "late orogenic"  Tarkwaian sediments of the Ashanti Belt (Perrouty et al., 2012; Sestini, 1973). Also located in the West African Craton, the world-class orogenic gold district of Siguiri  (Steyn, 2012; Lebrun et al., in review 2015; Chapter 3) is hosted in the north of the Siguiri Basin  (Guinea), about 200 km south-west of Bamako in Mali and 150 km north of Kankan, the second  53<br><b>Geocode:</b> Ashanti Region, Ghana<br><b>Pages:</b> 120,47<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

In West Africa, the Ashanti fault system in  Ghana, is one example of such a network, and its many faults host some of the biggest vein- hosted  and  fault-vein-hosted  orogenic  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Obuasi,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002;  Fougerouse  et  al.,  this  volume). The  Siguiri  district  (240  t/7.9  Moz;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  2013;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  n.d.)  is  unusual  in  West  Africa  because  it  is  not  located  on  a  recognized  large  regional  scale  fault  system.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Ashanti Region, Ghana<br><b>Pages:</b> 88<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

When  the  switch  occurs, a stress threshold is overcome allowing the barrier to be breached and fluids to flow  into an organized vein network. Geodynamic interpretation and drivers of stress-switches  Drivers of the different stress-switches observed in the Siguiri district may have a local  cause, including: 1) continuous local overburden build up; 2) fault irregularities; 3) earthquake  focal  behaviour  dynamics,  or  4)  a  regional  scale mechanism,  such  as  plate  convergence  rate  drop (Upton and Craw, 2013; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Beroza and Zoback, 1993). However, stress- switches  have  been  documented  in  many  other  orogenic  gold  systems  around  the  world,  including Archean examples (Bouiller and Robert, 1992;  Holyland and Ojala, 1997; Nguyen et  al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; e.g. in the Yilgarn: the Waroonga  and  New-Holland-Genesis  deposits,  Thébaud  et  al.,  2013). In  the  Birimian  of  West  Africa,  stress-switches have been recognised as one of the crucial triggers for mineralization in several  gold  deposits  (Ashanti  in  Ghana,  Sadiola,  Loulo  and  possibly  Morila  in  Mali,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a;  Masurel  et  al.,  this  volume;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Jerusalem In Ghana, Apimpua Road, Adum, Kumasi, Kumasi Metropolitan District, Ashanti Region, Ghana<br><b>Pages:</b> 129<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Normal  probability  plots  are  used  to  verify  if  a  dataset  displays  a  normal  distribution (straight line) and/or if multiple populations can be separated. Alteration  Comparison  between  least  altered  samples  and  mineralized  samples  of  each  rock  types and in each formation allow for the characterization of the suite of elements enriched or  depleted towards the ore zones. In the Kintinian conglomerate (Figure 42B), mineralisation is  associated with major increases in Au, Ba, Bi, Cu, K, Rb, S, Te, W, Zn, minor increases in F, Fe,  Mg,  Ni,  Sn  and  minor  decreases  in  As  and  Na  compared  to  the  least  altered  conglomerate  sample (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Geochemical variations linked to mineralisation in  the  Fatoya  shale  beds  are  associated with major  increases  in  Au,  As,  Bi,  Na,  S, Te, W, minor  increases in Ag, Cu, Sr and decreases in Ba, K, P, Rb, Zn (Figure  42C). || The  Saraya  area  is  located  ~50  km  west  of  the  Siguiri  district  (area  around  sample  Si327 on Figure  3B). The  lithostratigraphy in the Saraya  area is similar to that of the district,  displaying  fine  micaceous  greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale  beds  alike  of  those  of  the  Balato,  Fatoya and Kintinian Formations. In AEM, the Saraya area shows a low response similar to that  of the Fatoya Formation. The Saraya metasediments are however overlain unconformably by  67 || These  deposits  are  spread  along  an  average  WNW-ESE  trend  across  the  three  different  sedimentary  Formations  hosting  the  district:  the  Kintinian,  Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  (Figure 2; Watts, 2010). Fieldwork was undertaken in all these deposits but the greater part of  the  work  was  focused  on  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti. This  choice  was  based on the:   1)  importance of the gold mineralisation in the deposit;  2)  hosting Formation;   3)  proximity to contact with another Formation;   4)  outcropping quality of the deposit, and;   5)  density of drill cores in the deposit. 34 || Whole-rock multi-element geochemistry  Baseline geochemistry  Comparison of the baseline geochemistry for the least altered samples of all three rock  types  (conglomerate,  shale  and  greywacke)  from  each  three  formations  hosting  the  Siguiri  district indicates that most elements have similar concentrations in all rock types of all three  formations (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). However, when data from the Kintinian, Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  are  normalised  to  a  sample  representative  of  the  dominant  lithology  found  in  the  Siguiri  district  (least  altered  greywacke  from  Kosise  in  the  Fatoya  Formation),  variations  in  a  suite  of  elements  can  be  observed  (Figure  42A). The  baseline  geochemical  variations between the three formations are also observed when comparing the geochemistry  of all collected samples (least altered and altered; Figure 43). In  particular,  baseline  geochemistry  of  the  Kintinian  Formation  is  associated  with  increased concentrations of Ca, F, Li, Mg, Ni, Sc, Sn, Sr, U, V (+ minor increases in Ga and W)  and decreased concentrations of As, Cu, Pr, Si and Zr when compared to the Fatoya and Balato  Formations (Figure 43; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Baseline geochemistry of the Balato  Formation,  when  compared  to  those  for  the  Kintinian  and  Fatoya  Formations,  is  associated  with a marked increase in Ba, minor increases in concentration of Bi, Cu, Hf, Pr, Sr, Th, Zn, Zr  and  a  minor  decrease  in  Ge  (Figure  43;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices). These  variations  shows  that  the  Balato  Formation  differs  geochemically  mainly  from  the  Kintinian  Formation  (Figure  42A  and  43).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Balato, Kouroussa Prefecture, Kankan Region, Guinea<br><b>Pages:</b> 171,172,173,22,34,61<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

In  the  west  of  the  Yanfolila  Belt, intermediate to felsic calc-alkaline volcanic rocks from the Niani suite were dated at ca. 2210 Ma and interpreted to be  arc-related and derived from subduction of a young and hot  oceanic plate (Lahondère et al., 2002). || controlling  the morphology  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. These  fundamental  structures are  viewed  as  the  first  order  structures  controlling  the  location  of  the  world-class  Siguiri  district  in  the  eponym Basin. District  to  deposit  scale  structural  work  indicates  that  the  Siguiri  district  underwent  four  deformation  events:  a  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  progressively  evolving into a transpression and later on into a transtension (early- and late-D3S respectively),  and a NW-SE compression (D4S). While D1S deformation is cryptic and commonly expressed as  F1S  recumbent  folds  with  E-W  to  NW-SE  and  NE-SW  striking  axial  traces,  D2S  is  typically  characterised by F2S upright folds with NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE striking axial planes that refolds  F1S folds and are responsible for the bulk of the deformation and structural grain observed in  the Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin. The F2S folds are overprinted by four main orientations of  structures that develop (or are reactivated) during the early stages of D3S deformation and are  consistent with a transpressional deformation: N-S thrusts, E-W normal faults, NE-SW dextral  shear  zones  and  WNW-ESE  sinistral  shear  zones. In  field  exposures  and  in  drill  core,  these  structures are typically discreet and only expressed as sub-vertical damage zones ten to fifteen  meters wide and characterised by an increase  in  vein  density or  by  disseminated pyrite.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Basin, Big Horn County, Wyoming, 82410, United States<br><b>Pages:</b> 31,6<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Fieldwork and sampling  In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  identified  in  the  previous  section,  fieldwork  was  conducted in and around the Siguiri district. A total of 22 weeks were spent in the field over  the  course  of  this  study. Fieldwork  was  focused  on  geological  and  structural  mapping,  core  logging and sampling in the  different  deposits of the district  but  was  also conducted around  the district and outside of the Siguiri Basin. Thirteen deposits from the Siguiri district were accessible over the course of this study.

The Siguiri gold district  currently  consists of eleven accessible deposits, and is the only  large  gold  district  (>  50  t  Au)  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  rocks  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Egal  et  al.,  1999). Previous work on the district have recognized grade trends but have struggled to put  the geology together and highlight the incipient structures that control gold mineralization at a  deposit,  district  and  regional-scale. Most  notably,  a  study  on  the  structural  controls  of  auriferous quartz veining in eight of the deposits of the district was conducted by Steyn (2012). Steyn (2012) concluded that mineralization is hosted by veins, mainly controlled by competent  lithologies  and  associated  with  N-S  to  NW-SE  fold  hinges  and  N-S  to  NE-SW  shear  zones  developed during  ENE-WSW  transpression. This paper  builds onto the observations made  by  Steyn (2012) and describes the different brittle, ductile and brittle-ductile structures observed  in  the  district,  including  the  different  vein  generations  from  five  representative  deposits  including Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. || Key deposits of the Siguiri district  The following section reviews the main geological characteristics and insights into the  mineralization of five key deposits from the Siguiri district: Bidini, Sanu Tinti, Kosise, Kami and  Sintroko PB1 (Figure 17).

For this  reason, key deposits were selected based on the formation and host rocks, the understanding  of the deposit structural framework, and the accessibility to fresh outcrops and core intersects. Three  deposits  were  identified  as  representative  of  the  Siguiri  district  mineralisation:  the  Bidini, Kosise and Sintroko PB1 deposits (Figure 33). General sampling  Sampling was designed to: 1) constrain the paragenesis of the district; 2) characterise  the geochemical halo associated with a representative mineralised shear zone; 3) compare the  geochemical changes between formations and host rocks, and; 4) compare the sulphide major  and trace elements and gold content of each vein generation and hydrothermal events. A total  of 37 representative fresh rock samples were collected. Due to the weathering profile reaching  depths  over  200  m,  drill  core  logging  was  conducted  and  used  to  guide  sampling. || Mineralisation footprints and regional timing of the  Siguiri orogenic gold district (Guinea, West  Africa)  Erwann Lebrun1, Nicolas Thébaud1, John Miller1, Malcolm Roberts2, Noreen Evans3  1: Centre for Exploration Targeting and ARC Centre of Excellence for Core to Crust Fluid Systems,  School  of  Earth  and  Environment,  Robert  Street  Building,  M006,  The  University  of  Western  Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA, 6009,  Australia  2: Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis, M010, The University of Western Australia,  35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia  3:  John  de  Laeter  Centre  for  Isotope  Research,  TIGeR,  Department  of  Applied  Geology,  Curtin  University, Perth, WA 6845, Australia  Abstract:  Siguiri  is  a  world-class  orogenic  gold  district  hosted  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  Upper  Birimian  to  Lower  Tarkwa  Group  sediments  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Guinea). The  district  is  characterized by a protracted deformation history associated with four main deformation events:  D1S  is  a  N-S  compression;  D2S  is  an  E-W  compression  progressively  evolving  into  an  early-D3S  transpression  and  then  into  a  late-D3S  NNW-SSE  transtension,  and  D4S  is  a  NE-SW  compression. Field observations, petrography and chemical analyses applied to three key deposits of the Siguiri  district  (Bidini,  Sintroko  PB1  and  Kosise)  suggest  that  the  hydrothermal  activity  in  the  district  is  polyphase  and  can  be  subdivided  into  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. The  first  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  barren  bedding-parallel  and  en-echelon  V2S  quartz- dominated-(pyrite) veins. The second hydrothermal event is characterised by the development of  V3A  pyrite-ankerite  veins  late  during  D3S.

Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || The third hydrothermal event is also represented by a distinct texture,  only  observed  in  the  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti  deposits. The  mineralisation  texture  found  in  the  Kintinian  polymict  conglomerate  is  represented  by  disseminated  pyrite,  accompanied  by  tourmaline,  rare  monazite  and  traces  of  late chalcopyrite, sphalerite,  hematite  and  ilmenite. Minor  sericitisation  and  carbonate  alteration  is  also  associated  with  this  mineralisation  texture. This disseminated mineralisation shows some degree of structural control (Kintinian- Fatoya  N-S  thrust  contact)  but  is  mainly  stratigraphically  controlled  by  the  Kintinian  conglomerate. Comparison  of  major  and  trace  element  signatures  by  LA-ICP-MS  and  EPMA  between the disseminated pyrite and the other generations of pyrite associated with D2S, D3S  and  D4S  deformation  indicates  that  the  Sanu  Tinti  disseminated  pyrite  presents  geochemical  196 || These  deposits  are  spread  along  an  average  WNW-ESE  trend  across  the  three  different  sedimentary  Formations  hosting  the  district:  the  Kintinian,  Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  (Figure 2; Watts, 2010). Fieldwork was undertaken in all these deposits but the greater part of  the  work  was  focused  on  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti. This  choice  was  based on the:   1)  importance of the gold mineralisation in the deposit;  2)  hosting Formation;   3)  proximity to contact with another Formation;   4)  outcropping quality of the deposit, and;   5)  density of drill cores in the deposit. 34 || These  deposits  highlight  critical  components of character of the host rocks, host rock controls on mineralization and also key  structural  features  with  different  relative  timing. The  five  deposits  selected  for  detailed  analysis were, from north to south: Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. The Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini  and  Kosise  deposits  are  all  located  near  or  at  the  contact  between  two  of  the  110 || This moderate-dipping cleavage  is the  first  mappable  fabric in the deposit, and the folds are  therefore  termed  F1S  . The  discreet  F1S  folds  are  refolded  by  a  second  generation  of  folds,  termed F2S. The F2S folds in Bidini are not associated with any mappable axial planar foliation. The Bidini deposit itself sits on the hinge of a larger scale F2S fold. This larger scale F2S fold is a  tight upright anticline with an estimated wavelength of about 500 meters. The axial surface of  113 || Whole-rock major and trace element geochemical analyses  Whole-rock  major  and  trace  element  compositions  were  measured  on  each  sample  collected  from  Bidini,  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1. The  aim  was  to  identify  1)  the  different  geochemical  variations  associated  with  mineralisation  between  the  three  sedimentary  formations hosting the Siguiri district, and; 2) the main geochemical differences between these  formations. Geochemical analyses (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices) were carried out by Intertek  Genalysis Laboratories in Perth, using a combination of analytical techniques detailed in Table  6 in Electronic Appendices. The Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Bunbury basalt  and Kerba granite standards were included to monitor instrument precision. Data precision for  both  standards  was  typically  within  3%  for  major  elements  and  10%  for  trace  elements. Detection  limits  for  each  element  are  provided  in  Table  6  in  Electronic  Appendices. || from V2S, V3A, V3B veins and syn-D4S all came from the Fatoya and Kintinian Formations (Kosise  and Bidini deposits). Small amounts of pyrite were found in the Balato Formation (Sintroko PB1  deposit) and could not be linked to any of the four generations. Samples of arsenopyrite came  from  the  Balato  and  Fatoya  Formations  (Sintroko  PB1  and  Bidini  deposits). Samples  were  separated according to the nature of their host rock (either greywacke, shale or conglomerate;  Table  5  in  Electronic  Appendices). Laser  ablation  was  used  to  provide  the  missing  links  between  the  different  textures  of  the  hydrothermal  mineral  assemblages  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district. In  particular,  laser  ablation  and  EPMA  data  allowed  the  comparison  of  the  major  and  trace  element  signatures  from  the  multiple  pyrite  generations  from  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1  and  the  pyrite  found  in  the  Bidini  conglomerate. || lattice  of  the  V3B  arsenopyrite  have  similar  Ag/Au  and  Ni/Co  ratios  to  all  pyrite  generations,  around 7.5 and 2.81 respectively (Figure 45E and 45I). In summary, while no arsenopyrite was  found in the Kintinian Formation, arsenopyrite from the Balato Formation shows enrichment in  Ag, Co, Cr, Cu, Sb, Ti (and minor Mn) and depletion in As when compared to the arsenopyrite  hosted in the Fatoya Formation (Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). Discussion  Polyphase hydrothermal activity and gold mineralisation  Field  observations  of  vein  cross-cutting  relationships,  core  logging  and  petrographic  descriptions from Bidini, Sintroko PB1 and Kosise, permit the construction of local paragenetic  sequences  for  each  individual  deposit  studied. When  compared  to  one  another,  the  local  paragenetic  sequences  are  homogeneous  across  the  Siguiri  district  and  are  characterised  by  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. These  events  were  correlated  in  the  district-scale  paragenetic sequence (Figure 46) summarized below. Together, the laser ablation data (Figure  45) and the general paragenetic  sequence of the district,  reflects  the polyphase  character of  gold mineralisation in Siguiri and three distinct gold mineralisation events were identified. || this anticline trends NNE-SSW, and its fold axis plunges shallowly to the north and south. An  asymmetric N-S trending F2S syncline with a western long limb, eastern short limb and an axial  surface  dipping  to  the  east,  occurs  in  between  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti,  giving  an  overall  west  vergence to the folding.

The  overall  asymmetric  fold  geometry  indicates  a  vergence  to  the  west  (Figure  17C). No axial planar cleavage (S2S) was identified as being associated with this event. A switch to a phase of brittle deformation marks the end stage of the D2S event in the  Siguiri district and is associated with the development of V2S veining and D2S brittle faults. The  V2S vein set is the oldest observed vein set in the Siguiri district, and it is not mineralized. The  orientation of this quartz-(carbonate) set varies from 320/80 in Sintroko PB1, to 070/40, and  280/45  in  the  Kosise  deposit. || C)  Folded  V3B  vein  and  axial  planar  S4S  cleavage.

F)  Structural  contact  (fault)  between  the  Kintinian and Fatoya Formations in the Sanu Tinti deposit. 175 || Cryptic  D1S:    The  first  deformation  event  D1S  is  a  ductile  deformation  event  characterized by its cryptic F1S folds, because rarely observed in the district, whose axial trace  strikes E-W to NW-SE and NE-SW (Figure 17). Remnants of these folds have been observed in  the northern part of the district (Bidini deposit, Figure 19A; Eureka North deposit, Figure 19B). The F1S folds are commonly tight with recumbent orientation, and fold axes gently plunging to  the E and WNW (axial plane and calculated fold axis on Figure 26A, 26B and 26C). In the Kami  deposit, where NE-SW trending F1S folds are gentle to open with wavelengths in the 100’s of  meters,  F2S  N-S  folds  overprint  the  F1S  folds  and  form  interpreted  type  1  fold  interference  pattern  characterized  by  large  domes  and  basins  (Figure  17  and  18B;  Ramsay  and  Huber,  1987). A  weakly  developed  cleavage  (S1S),  shallowly  to  moderately  dipping  to  the  WSW  is  locally observed in some of the northern deposits (e.g. Bidini; Figure 26E, 26F, 26G and 26H). || Figure  18:  Detailed  structural  form  line  maps  of  the  A)  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti  deposits;  B)  Kami  deposit;  C)  Kosise  deposit, and; D) Sintroko PB1 deposit. Each map is accompanied by the deposit cross-section, denoted in red letters. Damage zones, distinct and incipient structures are all represented by a thick black line. Discrete folds occur in the southeastern part of the Bidini deposit (Figure 19A). These  gently  inclined  to  recumbent  folds  are  open  to  tight,  and  have  a  wavelength  of  about  15  meters and fold axes that plunge moderately to the WSW. These folds are associated with an  axial planar cleavage that trends NW-SE to N-S and dips shallowly to moderately to the WSW. || Figure  35:  Simplified  structural  maps  and  cross-sections  of  key  deposits  from  the  Siguiri  district  (location  map  on  Figure 33). A) Sanu Tinti and Bidini; B) Kosise, and; C) Sintroko PB1. Locations of the drill holes and collected samples  highlighted. Fatoya Formation sediments in the Bidini deposit display various sedimentary features  that can be used as way-up indicators, such as: cross-bedding, rip-up clasts and ripple marks. Metre-thick  beds  of  medium  grained  greywacke  and  sandstone  dominate,  however  fine  alternations of siltstone and shale can also be occasionally found, as well as some black shale  layers. In  this  deposit,  the  Fatoya  Formation  is  overlying  up  to  100  m  of  conglomerate  interbeds, intersected in core BDRCDD009 (Figure 35A and 36). || In  the  disseminated  pyrite,  gold  was  found  free  along  fractures  associated  with  chalcopyrite,  hematite and galena. The crystal lattice of the disseminated pyrite was however found to be  barren (~3 ppm Au maximum; Figure 45; Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). The  last  hydrothermal  event  is  a  late  overprint,  which  developed  during  D4S  NW-SE  compression and formed the S4S cleavage. This cleavage is characterised by strain shadows of  sericite, quartz, ankerite and albite around V3B arsenopyrite crystals. Chlorite, hematite, pyrite,  chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, magnetite can also be found in these strain shadows or in  veinlets  overprinting  the  syn-V3B  disseminated  pyrite  in  the  Kintinian  conglomerate. Even  though no significant gold was found locked in syn-D4S pyrite (~3 ppm Au maximum), free gold  has  been  described  in  both  Bidini  and  Kosise  deposits  infilling  fractures  or  strain  shadow  of  early  mineralised  V3B  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite  with  chalcopyrite,  hematite  and  galena. || In drill core, V3A veins often have brecciated  textures and range from a few mm up to 20 cm. In comparison, individual V3B veins typically  have antitaxial textures (Passchier and Trouw, 2005) and are only a few cm to 15 cm thick but  can extend for up to tens of metres. Supergene alteration has formed a centimetre wide halo  of iron oxides around the V3B veins, preserving them from further weathering (Figure 37C). Mineral assemblages and mineralisation  Hydrothermal  mineral  assemblages  in  the  Bidini  deposit  occurs  as  two  styles  of  mineralisation  dependant  on  whether  these  assemblages  are  hosted  by  the  greywacke  or  shale beds of the Fatoya Formation or in the conglomerate of the Kintinian Formation. In the  Fatoya Formation, hydrothermal activity has formed veins whereas in the Kintinian Formation,  hydrothermal alteration is disseminated throughout the matrix and clasts of the conglomerate  (Figure 34D). In  the  Fatoya  Formation,  mineralisation  is  controlled  by  early-D3S  N-W  and  NE-SW  damage  zones,  around  which  V3S  veining  develops. || In the Bidini deposit, bedding strikes N-NE on average with multiple small-scale open  F2S  folds. The  deposit  sits  on  the  hinge  of  a  refolded  F2S  anticline  the  fold  axes  of  which  dip  shallowly  to the  north  and  south  (Figure  33  and  35A). The  F2S  folds  are  crosscut  by  multiple  early-D3S sub-vertical incipient structures oriented NE-SW and N-S (Figure 37A). These incipient  structures  are  mainly  developed  in  the  centre  of  the  deposit  and  are  expressed  as  discreet  damage zones associated with areas about ten metres wide where the density of mineralised  V3B veins increases (Figure 37B; Lebrun et al., in review 2015a; Chapter 3). These damage zones  can extend up to 300 metres in depth (Figure 35A). Veining in Bidini is dominated by the V3B  vein set (Figure 37B and 37C) and some V3A veins. || Sample  BDRCDD009  402,  meta-greywacke  (WGS84,  UTM  29N,  East.:  460946,  North.:  1280579, Elev.: 352 m)  This sample comes from the base of the Kintinian Formation, below the Bidini deposit. It is a medium-grained, equigranular, massive, feldspathic greywacke (~50 vol% matrix) at sub- greenschist facies. Petrographic observations indicate that its modal composition is around: 20  vol% quartz, 25 vol% albite, 20 vol% white micas. Zircon yield was low and the average crystal  size  is  60x80  μm. The  zircons  are  mostly  colourless  and  fractured  but  remain  subhedral  to  euhedral with a prismatic habit. Cl imaging shows that grain exhibit oscillatory zoning (Figure  11D). || Samples  were collected from drill-core and the sample-size was kept consistent to a quarter core of 50  cm  long  (~1  kg)  for  most  samples  and  about  2  to  3  kg  for  conglomerate  samples. Seven  samples were collected in the Bidini deposit from hole BDRCDD009 (Figure 35A), which starts  in  the  Fatoya  Formation  and  ends  in  the  Kintinian  Formation. Five  of  these  samples  were  collected  from  the  conglomerate  interbeds  (samples  BD2,  BD3  and  BD5  to  BD7;  Table  3  in  Electronic Appendices) while the last two samples were of greywacke and shale beds from the  Kintinian  Formation  (samples  BD1  and  BD4;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices;  Figure  36). Eighteen samples were collected along holes KSDD018, KSDD020, KSDD022 and KSDD024 from  the Kosise deposit (samples A to R; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices; Figure 35B). All of these  drill-holes intersect the Fatoya Formation only. Sampling was focused on the greywacke beds,  167 || Sanu Tinti  The  Sanu  Tinti  deposit  is one  of  the  northernmost  deposits (Figure  17). It  sits  at  the  contact between the greywacke-dominated Fatoya Formation to the east, and the overturned  and  younger  Kintinian  Formation  to  the  west  (Figure  18A). The  Kintinian  Formation  in  Sanu  Tinti  is  characterized  by  a  basal  sequence  of  polymict,  clast  supported  conglomerate. The  remainder of the Kintinian Formation outcropping in this deposit is composed of shale and fine  siltstone beds. The deposit is on the western long limb of a large scale F2S N-S trending open to  close syncline within the Fatoya Formation. This N-S syncline has an E-dipping axial plane that  shows a fold vergence to the west, has a wavelength of about 500 meters, and extends into  the  Bidini  deposit  (Figure  19C). || The matrix correction method was  ZAF utilising the algorithm of Armstrong/Love Scott (Armstrong, 1988). X-Ray  Diffraction  (XRD)  was  used  to  characterise  the  modal  composition  and  its  variations  of  the  geochemical  samples  collected  in  the  Kosise  deposit. Analyses  were  conducted on a Panalytical Empyrean multi-purpose research XRD spectrometer at the CMCA,  UWA. Spectra  were  processed  with  the  HighScore  Plus  software  and  the  final  weighted  R  profile values were all between 5.89 and 11.4 with an average of 8.7. LA-ICP-MS  was  conducted on  all  generations of  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite  found  in  the  district  (V2S,  V3A,  V3B  and  syn-D4S),  as  well  as  on  unconstrained  disseminated  pyrite  hosted  in  the  conglomerate of  the  Bidini  deposit  (Table  4  in  Electronic  Appendices). Samples  of  pyrite  169 || supported  by  other  studies  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006;  Price  and  Pichler,  2006). Variations  in  As  content also have a direct impact on the unit cell parameters of the pyrite crystal lattice (a, b, c  distances between atoms and α, β, γ angles between a, b and c) which affects the capacity of  this  mineral  to  contain  gold  (Large  et  al.,  2011;  Savage  et  al.,  2000). This  conclusion  is  highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite:  more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure  45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for  the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the  Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit. Comparison with other West African orogenic gold deposits  The  Siguiri  mineralisation  footprint  has  many  similarities  with  other  West  African  orogenic gold deposits. In particular, mineralisation at the Massawa deposit in Eastern Senegal  (Treloar et al., 2014) is structurally controlled and hosted along sub-vertical NE-trending shear  zones similar to the Kosise deposit.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Bidiņi, Rucavas pagasts, Dienvidkurzemes novads, LV-3477, Latvia<br><b>Pages:</b> 106,115,116,152,154,158,160,161,181,183,72,98<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

When  the  switch  occurs, a stress threshold is overcome allowing the barrier to be breached and fluids to flow  into an organized vein network. Geodynamic interpretation and drivers of stress-switches  Drivers of the different stress-switches observed in the Siguiri district may have a local  cause, including: 1) continuous local overburden build up; 2) fault irregularities; 3) earthquake  focal  behaviour  dynamics,  or  4)  a  regional  scale mechanism,  such  as  plate  convergence  rate  drop (Upton and Craw, 2013; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Beroza and Zoback, 1993). However, stress- switches  have  been  documented  in  many  other  orogenic  gold  systems  around  the  world,  including Archean examples (Bouiller and Robert, 1992;  Holyland and Ojala, 1997; Nguyen et  al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; e.g. in the Yilgarn: the Waroonga  and  New-Holland-Genesis  deposits,  Thébaud  et  al.,  2013).

Alteration  Comparison  between  least  altered  samples  and  mineralized  samples  of  each  rock  types and in each formation allow for the characterization of the suite of elements enriched or  depleted towards the ore zones. In the Kintinian conglomerate (Figure 42B), mineralisation is  associated with major increases in Au, Ba, Bi, Cu, K, Rb, S, Te, W, Zn, minor increases in F, Fe,  Mg,  Ni,  Sn  and  minor  decreases  in  As  and  Na  compared  to  the  least  altered  conglomerate  sample (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Geochemical variations linked to mineralisation in  the  Fatoya  shale  beds  are  associated with major  increases  in  Au,  As,  Bi,  Na,  S, Te, W, minor  increases in Ag, Cu, Sr and decreases in Ba, K, P, Rb, Zn (Figure  42C). || The  Saraya  area  is  located  ~50  km  west  of  the  Siguiri  district  (area  around  sample  Si327 on Figure  3B). The  lithostratigraphy in the Saraya  area is similar to that of the district,  displaying  fine  micaceous  greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale  beds  alike  of  those  of  the  Balato,  Fatoya and Kintinian Formations. In AEM, the Saraya area shows a low response similar to that  of the Fatoya Formation. The Saraya metasediments are however overlain unconformably by  67 || The basal Kintinian olistostrome marks the interface between the Fatoya and Kintinian  Formations and can be traced in regional magnetic datasets and by field mapping as a narrow  N-S belt across the entire Siguiri Basin (Figure 10). The prominence of this N-S trend in other  major volcano-sedimentary belts across the West African Craton, parallel to the central Siguiri  Basin (e.g. Yanfolila Belt; Figure 3A), indicates probable basement structure reactivation. Bends  in  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  and  in  the  rest  of  the  lithostratigraphy  defined  in  the  Siguiri  district  can  be  observed  both  at  the  scale  of  the  district  (Figure  5)  and  at  the  regional  scale  where  the  olistostrome  forms  a  “Z”-shaped  unit  recognized  across  the  entire  Siguiri  Basin  (Figure  3B  and  10). The  peculiar  shape  of  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  recognized  across  the  Siguiri Basin originated from the first phases of orogenic contraction affecting the Basin, such  as  D1S  N-S  compression. The  WNW-ESE,  N-S  and  NE-SW  structures  that  bound  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  across  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Figure  3B,  5  and  10)  are  therefore  considered  to  represent  fundamental  deeper  basement  structures  that  controlled  the  thickness  and  morphology of this unit at the time of its deposition. || These  deposits  are  spread  along  an  average  WNW-ESE  trend  across  the  three  different  sedimentary  Formations  hosting  the  district:  the  Kintinian,  Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  (Figure 2; Watts, 2010). Fieldwork was undertaken in all these deposits but the greater part of  the  work  was  focused  on  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti. This  choice  was  based on the:   1)  importance of the gold mineralisation in the deposit;  2)  hosting Formation;   3)  proximity to contact with another Formation;   4)  outcropping quality of the deposit, and;   5)  density of drill cores in the deposit. 34 || This fabric is overprinted by bedding parallel veins following the western long limb of the large  scale F2S N-S trending syncline developed in the Fatoya side of the deposit (Figure 18A). Sub-vertical ENE-trending veins were  found to cut across the  large scale  F2S  syncline. These veins often display a conjugate geometry and are a few centimeters to 15 centimeters  thick, but can extend for tens of meters in length (Figure 21A). In Sanu Tinti, these conjugate  veins are typically oriented in two main sets: 335/82 and 196/84. Either of these sets can have  a conjugate geometry with additional secondary veins of similar orientation to the other vein  set. In the northern part of the Sanu Tinti deposit, the density of these veins increases up to  121 || Whole-rock multi-element geochemistry  Baseline geochemistry  Comparison of the baseline geochemistry for the least altered samples of all three rock  types  (conglomerate,  shale  and  greywacke)  from  each  three  formations  hosting  the  Siguiri  district indicates that most elements have similar concentrations in all rock types of all three  formations (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). However, when data from the Kintinian, Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  are  normalised  to  a  sample  representative  of  the  dominant  lithology  found  in  the  Siguiri  district  (least  altered  greywacke  from  Kosise  in  the  Fatoya  Formation),  variations  in  a  suite  of  elements  can  be  observed  (Figure  42A). The  baseline  geochemical  variations between the three formations are also observed when comparing the geochemistry  of all collected samples (least altered and altered; Figure 43). In  particular,  baseline  geochemistry  of  the  Kintinian  Formation  is  associated  with  increased concentrations of Ca, F, Li, Mg, Ni, Sc, Sn, Sr, U, V (+ minor increases in Ga and W)  and decreased concentrations of As, Cu, Pr, Si and Zr when compared to the Fatoya and Balato  Formations (Figure 43; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Baseline geochemistry of the Balato  Formation,  when  compared  to  those  for  the  Kintinian  and  Fatoya  Formations,  is  associated  with a marked increase in Ba, minor increases in concentration of Bi, Cu, Hf, Pr, Sr, Th, Zn, Zr  and  a  minor  decrease  in  Ge  (Figure  43;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices). These  variations  shows  that  the  Balato  Formation  differs  geochemically  mainly  from  the  Kintinian  Formation  (Figure  42A  and  43). || compositional  variation  across  the  Basin,  consistent  with  the  local  geology. For  instance,  limestone clasts were observed in the conglomerate from the Marble Hill location (Figure  5),  north-west  of  the  Siguiri  district  is  dominated  by  shale  and  greywacke  from  the  Fatoya  and  Balato Formations. U-Pb detrital zircon geochronology  Few  geochronological  constraints  exist  over  the  study  area  and  the  broader  Siguiri  Basin  area  (Egal  et  al.,  1999;  Egal  et  al.,  2002;  Feybesse  et  al.,  1999). Sample  details  and  analytical data for each sample are below and in Table 1 (in Electronic Appendices). Sample  SKRCDD040  236.5,  meta-greywacke  (WGS84,  UTM  29N,  East.:  462781,  North.:  1271072, Elev.: 364 m)  This  sample  is  a  fine-grained,  massive,  equigranular,  dark  grey  greywacke  (~60  vol%  matrix)  at  sub-greenschist  facies  from  the  Balato  Formation  (Sintroko  PB1  deposit). Modal  composition  for  quartz,  albite  and  white  micas  of  around  20,  25  and  20  vol%  respectively. || sedimentation. However, available data show that the Kintinian conglomerates occur as thick  (~10-15 m) deposits overlain by thin (<50 cm) shale to mudstone intervals. The conglomerates  were observed at  the contact  with Fatoya greywackes, above  a thrust  fault in the  Sanu Tinti  deposit, and reworking meta-limestone/marble in drill cores from the Silakoro area. Based on  the  current  data,  the  conglomeratic  layers  sit  near  the  base  of  the  Kintinian  Formation,  are  overlain  by  mudstone  and  boudinaged  limestone  interbeds  representing  the  bulk  of  the  Kintinian Formation (Figure 6F), and their true thickness varies across the map and in cores. In  order  to  integrate  the  observations  from  the  Siguiri  district  in  the  broader  Siguiri  basin  framework,  two  additional  localities  were  investigated: the  Marble  Hill  and  the  Saraya  area  (Figure  3B  and  5A). Located  between  the  Kintinian  and  the  Fatoya  Formations  in  map  view  (area  around  sample  Si241  on  Figure  5A),  the  Marble  Hill  displays  conglomerate  and  greywacke sitting on top of strongly foliated meta-limestone beds (Figure 6D). || supported conglomerate beds.

The Fatoya Formation is dominated by normally-graded (fining-upward), dm to m-thick  beds  of  medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  grading  upwards  to  siltstone  and  mudstone  (Figure 5C, 5D, 6B).

(1989); Milési et al., (1992). The  location  of  orogenic  gold  deposits  is  typically  controlled  by  complex  regional-scale  fault  networks (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2000). In West Africa, the Ashanti fault system in  Ghana, is one example of such a network, and its many faults host some of the biggest vein- hosted  and  fault-vein-hosted  orogenic  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Obuasi,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002;  Fougerouse  et  al.,  this  volume). The  Siguiri  district  (240  t/7.9  Moz;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  2013;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  n.d.)  is  unusual  in  West  Africa  because  it  is  not  located  on  a  recognized  large  regional  scale  fault  system. || The Kintinian Formation – a Tarkwa Group sequence? With  the  sole  base  of  the  geochronological  record  it  remains  difficult  to  determine  wether the Siguiri district sediments  belong to the Upper Birimian or Tarka Group. The first  detailed  study  of  the  Tarkwaian  sedimentary  rocks  lithotype  in  Ghana,  defining  the  Tarkwa  Group,  was  conducted  over  40  years  ago  by  Sestini  (1973). The  Tarkwaian  consists  of  intercalations  of  conglomerates,  sandstones  and  phyllites. The  conglomeratic  layers  display  Birimian quartz pebbles and volcanic clasts and were interpreted to represent piedmont-type  deposits (short transport in an environment of active continental erosion; Bossière et al., 1996;  Mueller et al., 1996), similar to that found on the southern foot of the Alps and the Himalayas  (Hirdes  and  Nunoo,  1994;  Sestini,  1973). Since  this  early  work,  sedimentary  rocks  from  the  Tarkwa Group have been described in other parts of the West African Craton. || ankerite, siderite nodules; Fougerouse et al., 2015). Other examples of similar  mineralisation  footprint  in  West  Africa  include  Wassa/Benso,  Damang  (Parra-Avila  et  al.,  in  review 2015; Pigois et al., 2003). The  structural  framework  and  geochronology  of  the  Kédougou-Kénieba  Inlier  (KKI),  Guinea, Mali, Ghana, and other West African references (Milési et al., 1989; Milési et al., 1992)  show that gold mineralisation in West Africa between ca. 2110-2060 Ma, occurred during two  main  events  (Figure  47). Both  gold  mineralisation  events  are  chronologically  associated  with  two distinct suites of intrusive rocks previously distinguished by Hirdes and Davis (2002). The  first  gold  mineralisation  event  occurs  between  ca. || As an example, numerous orogenic gold deposits hosted in sedimentary basins around  the  world  are  interpreted  to  be  sitting  on  early  structures  highlighted  in  the  field  through  lithofacies  variations. For  example,  the  Kirkland  Lake  deposit  hosted  along  the  Kirkland-Lake  Cadillac fault that marks the unconformity between the Timiskaming sediments and the Abitibi  Supergroup  in  Canada  (Hyde,  1980). Similarly  in  the  Western  Australian  Yilgarn  craton,  gold  deposits such as Ant Hill, Bullant, Porphyry and Wattlebird are hosted along the Ballard-Zuleika  Shear Zone and highlighted by the Kurrawang Group sediments (Robert et al., 2005; Mueller et  al., 1996; Weinberg et al., n.d.). In the West African Craton, the giant Obuasi deposit in Ghana  is hosted along the  Ashanti fault separating the Birimian sediments from the "late orogenic"  Tarkwaian sediments of the Ashanti Belt (Perrouty et al., 2012; Sestini, 1973).

The  district  is  characterized by a protracted deformation history associated with four main deformation events:  D1S  is  a  N-S  compression;  D2S  is  an  E-W  compression  progressively  evolving  into  an  early-D3S  transpression  and  then  into  a  late-D3S  NNW-SSE  transtension,  and  D4S  is  a  NE-SW  compression. Field observations, petrography and chemical analyses applied to three key deposits of the Siguiri  district  (Bidini,  Sintroko  PB1  and  Kosise)  suggest  that  the  hydrothermal  activity  in  the  district  is  polyphase  and  can  be  subdivided  into  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. The  first  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  barren  bedding-parallel  and  en-echelon  V2S  quartz- dominated-(pyrite) veins. The second hydrothermal event is characterised by the development of  V3A  pyrite-ankerite  veins  late  during  D3S. Laser  ablation  data  show  that  this  vein  set  contains  an  anomalous gold content  of up to 43.3 ppm locked in its pyrite crystal lattice. || SUPPORTING REFERENCES  In  addition  to  the  three  journal  publications  submitted  submitted  forming  the  main  chapters of this thesis, the PhD candidate Lebrun wrote another submitted publication and six  abstracts and extended abstracts for a number of international conferences:  Publications  Lebrun, E., Ulrich, S., Miller, J., Thébaud, N. and T.

Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || The Siguiri Basin covers about 40,000 km² in Guinea and adjacent Mali. It consists of  upper  Birimian  sedimentary,  volcaniclastic  and  volcanic  rocks  and  intrusive  rocks. The  upper  Birimian  sediments  were  derived  from  Paleoproterozoic  volcanic  rocks  and  felsic  intrusions  that were emplaced during the early stages of the Eburnean orogeny (Milési et al. 1989; Begg  et al. 2009; Feybesse and Milési 1994). The Siguiri Basin is bordered to the south-west by the  Niandan komatiite suite and the mafic to felsic volcanic rocks of the Kéniéro Range (not shown  on map), dated at ca. || Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  the  gold events  in  Siguiri  (syn-D3S  and  syn-D4S)  occurred  during  the  ca. 2102-2085  Ma  episode  of  gold  mineralisation  recognized across the West African Craton. These conclusions have a direct impact on orogenic  gold  exploration  since  these  suggest  that  younger  economic  gold  mineralisation  coeval  with  the  second  episode  of  magmatism  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma,  such  as  the  late  gold  overprint  in  Morila, could be found in the Siguiri Basin. Conclusion  The Siguiri district, hosted in the weakly metamorphosed sediments of the Siguiri Basin  (Guinea)  is  characterized  by  a  polyphase  hydrothermal  history  and  two  textures  of  the  hydrothermal mineral assemblages. The dominant texture, or Kosise style, displays vein haloes  structurally  controlled  by  early-D3S  N-S,  NE-SW,  WNW-ESE  and  E-W  damage  zones. || and T.

The  structural  framework  and  geochronology  of  the  Kédougou-Kénieba  Inlier  (KKI),  Guinea, Mali, Ghana, and other West African references (Milési et al., 1989; Milési et al., 1992)  show that gold mineralisation in West Africa between ca. 2110-2060 Ma, occurred during two  main  events  (Figure  47). Both  gold  mineralisation  events  are  chronologically  associated  with  two distinct suites of intrusive rocks previously distinguished by Hirdes and Davis (2002).

Due to its very poor outcropping quality, the lithostratigraphy of the Siguiri Basin has  received  little  attention,  and  existing  studies  have  mostly  focused  on  the  importance  of  magmatism during the Eburnean orogeny (Egal et al., 2002). Early regional mapping from the  French Geological Survey (BRGM) described the Siguiri Basin  as an homogeneous package of  undifferentiated fine sedimentary rocks (Egal et al., 1999; Feybesse et al., 1999). This  paper  presents  a  multi-disciplinary  study  combining  sedimentological,  geochronological  and  geophysical  analyses  over  the  Siguiri  district  that  allows  for  further  discrimination of the Siguiri Basin sedimentary record. Used collectively, the datasets constrain  the lithostratigraphic succession of the central Siguiri Basin and permit the drafting of a new  geological  map  for  this  critical  region. || residuum gold (e.g. Yatela; Hanssen et al., 2004) and placer type deposits (e.g. Tarkwa; Sestini,  1973; Pigois et al., 2003).

Fieldwork and sampling  In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  identified  in  the  previous  section,  fieldwork  was  conducted in and around the Siguiri district. A total of 22 weeks were spent in the field over  the  course  of  this  study. Fieldwork  was  focused  on  geological  and  structural  mapping,  core  logging and sampling in the  different  deposits of the district  but  was  also conducted around  the district and outside of the Siguiri Basin. Thirteen deposits from the Siguiri district were accessible over the course of this study. From  south  to  north:  Sintroko  PB1,  Sintroko  PB2C,  Sintroko  PB3A,  Sintroko  North,  Kosise,  Kami, Kozan, Kalamagna PB1, Tubani, Bidini, Sanu Tinti, Eureka North and Seguelen (Figure 2). || Gold  mineralisation  in  the  Kami  and  Kosise  deposits  is  associated  with  veins  that  crosscut the oldest quartz-dominated vein sets and developed adjacent to discrete fault zones  and  also  with  veins  within  damage  zones  related  to  incipient  structures. The  vein  arrays  occurring adjacent to the discrete fault zones and within the damage zones, can be separated  into  two  generations. The first  generation  of  these  veins  consists  of  ankerite-pyrite  and  rare  albite,  and  was  only  observed  in  drill  core  and  develops  in  the  first  few  meters  around  the  damage zone linked to the discrete fault zones (Figure 20B and 20C). These veins orientation  could  only  be  constrained  from  drill  core  observation,  and  do  not  show  a  consistent  orientation  (Figure  20B). These  veins  are  a  few  millimeters  up  to  15  centimeters  thick  and  commonly display brecciated textures (Figure 20B). Their lateral extent is not known. || In other deposits, such as in Kami,  these structures are expressed as  shear zones and damage zones displaying arrays of V3S veins that cut across bedding. -  Local E-W trending sub-vertical normal faults, typically expressed as damage zones. -  A  WNW-ESE  trending  fault  population  that  dips  moderately  to  the  SSW  and  is  axial  planar  to  the  F1S  folds. Such  a  fault,  located  in  the  northernmost  part  of  the  Siguiri  district (Figure 17), was interpreted by Egal et al. (1999) to display sinistral movement. -  Sub-vertical  NE-SW-  to  ENE-WSW-trending  strike-slip  brittle  to  brittle-ductile  shear  zones and damage zones exhibiting dextral movement. || In the field, veins from one set can be  found  conjugate  with  veins  from  the  other,  or  with  other  secondary  veins  with  a  slightly  differently orientation (Figure 23B). In the first ten to fifteen meters away from these damage  zones  the  conjugate  vein  sets  can  also  be  found  in  domal  structures  along  particularly  competent  greywacke  beds  (Figure  23A). The  bulk of  the  gold  found  in  the  Kami  and  Kosise  deposits is associated with these quartz-ankerite-arsenopyrite veins. Native gold can be found  in the quartz veins and along the ankerite rims. Free gold can also be found in the arsenopyrite  and  along  fractures  associated  with  chalcopyrite,  galena  and  some  sphalerite. Gold  grades  125 || Instead  it  is  located  in  the  center  of  a  large  sedimentary basin in the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain of the West African Craton. The Siguiri gold district  currently  consists of eleven accessible deposits, and is the only  large  gold  district  (>  50  t  Au)  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  rocks  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Egal  et  al.,  1999). Previous work on the district have recognized grade trends but have struggled to put  the geology together and highlight the incipient structures that control gold mineralization at a  deposit,  district  and  regional-scale. Most  notably,  a  study  on  the  structural  controls  of  auriferous quartz veining in eight of the deposits of the district was conducted by Steyn (2012). Steyn (2012) concluded that mineralization is hosted by veins, mainly controlled by competent  lithologies  and  associated  with  N-S  to  NW-SE  fold  hinges  and  N-S  to  NE-SW  shear  zones  developed during  ENE-WSW  transpression. This paper  builds onto the observations made  by  Steyn (2012) and describes the different brittle, ductile and brittle-ductile structures observed  in  the  district,  including  the  different  vein  generations  from  five  representative  deposits  including Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. || Key deposits of the Siguiri district  The following section reviews the main geological characteristics and insights into the  mineralization of five key deposits from the Siguiri district: Bidini, Sanu Tinti, Kosise, Kami and  Sintroko PB1 (Figure 17). Bidini  The  Bidini  deposit  is  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the  district  (Figure  17). Bidini  is  hosted  in  the  greywacke-dominated  Fatoya  Formation,  and  is  adjacent  to  the  Sanu  Tinti  111 || Native gold can be found within the quartz or on the margin of the quartz and ankerite (Figure  20E). Kami and Kosise  The  Kami  and  Kosise  deposits  are  both  hosted  in  the  Fatoya  Formation,  which  is  dominated by meter-thick greywacke-sandstone beds fining up into, or alternating with, minor  centimeter-thick  beds  of  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  17). Kami  sits  in  the  centre  of  the  Formation, whereas Kosise sits further to the east. The  Kami  deposit  has  a  structural  style  characterized  by  open  F1S  upright  folds  with  fold  axes  gently  plunging  to  the  NE  or  the  SW  and  by  open  F2S  upright  folds  with  fold  axes  gently  plunging  to  the  north  or  south. The  intersection  of  these  folds  forms  a  broad  domal  structure that hosts the Kami deposit. The Kosise deposit is adjacent to Kami and is hosted on  the hinge and short limb of an open N-S F2S syncline which has a sub-horizontal fold axis. || Similar  N-S,  E-W,  WNW-ESE  and  NE-SW  damage  zones  extending along strike over a few hundred meters to more than a kilometer were recognized in  the  field  (Figure  17,  18B  and  18C). The  only  N-S  damage  zone  recognized  in  Kosise  is  sub- parallel to the stratigraphy and extends to the Kozan deposit, which displays similar structural  features  (Figure  17  and  19D). No  kinematic  indicators  could  be  observed  in  the  WNW-ESE  damage zones in Kami or Kosise. 123 || Structural  controls  on  an  orogenic  gold  system:  The  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district,  Siguiri  Basin, Guinea, West Africa  Erwann Lebrun1, John Miller1, Nicolas Thébaud1, Stanislav Ulrich2, T.

Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || The  en-echelon  veins  are  typically  thinner  and  rarely  exceed 4 centimeters in thickness. The en-echelon vein arrays can extend over 2-3 meters, but  individual  veins  typically  extend  for  up  to  50  centimeters. This  oldest  vein  set  is  not  mineralized. The  veins,  the  open  folds in  Kami and  the  F2S  syncline  in  Kosise  are  crosscut by  sub- vertical  discrete  shear  zones,  or  by  what  have  been  defined  as  incipient  structures. For  example,  a  meter-wide  discrete  NE-SW  fault  zone  displaying  dextral  kinematics  is  a  major  structural feature observed in the Kosise deposit (Figure 24C, 24D and 24E) and vein patterns  along minor E-W  trending fault zones  in the  Kami deposit  indicate  normal movements along  these  discrete  structures. However,  incipient  structures  are  more  common  than  discrete  structures in the Kosise and Kami deposits, and are expressed by an abundance of veins along  a 10 to 15 meters-wide damage zone of sheet-like geometry with no visible discrete zone of  faulting  or  shearing  (Figure  24B). || These  deposits  are  spread  along  an  average  WNW-ESE  trend  across  the  three  different  sedimentary  Formations  hosting  the  district:  the  Kintinian,  Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  (Figure 2; Watts, 2010). Fieldwork was undertaken in all these deposits but the greater part of  the  work  was  focused  on  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti. This  choice  was  based on the:   1)  importance of the gold mineralisation in the deposit;  2)  hosting Formation;   3)  proximity to contact with another Formation;   4)  outcropping quality of the deposit, and;   5)  density of drill cores in the deposit. 34 || These  deposits  highlight  critical  components of character of the host rocks, host rock controls on mineralization and also key  structural  features  with  different  relative  timing. The  five  deposits  selected  for  detailed  analysis were, from north to south: Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. The Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini  and  Kosise  deposits  are  all  located  near  or  at  the  contact  between  two  of  the  110 || shear  zone,  but  no  kinematic  indicators  were  identified. A  series  of  sub-vertical  incipient  structures oriented N-S, NE-SW and E-W also crosscut the F2S folds (Figure 18D). Like at Kami  and Kosise these cross cutting incipient structures are not characterised by any distinctive fault  plane  but  are  rather  expressed  as  a  damage  zone  defined  by  an  increase  in  vein  density  defining a planar zone 10-15 meters thick of dense veining (Figure 19E, 24A and 24B). Veining  associated with the damage zones is also preferentially developed in competent beds (Figure  24A  and  24B). The  veins  associated  with  the  damage  zones,  and  with  the  central  NNE-SSW  shear zones, display various orientations that can be grouped into two distinct conjugate sets. These vein sets  are oriented around 172/26 and 150/70. || structures (Figure 28C). However, some are represented by discrete shear zones, in some cases  via  bedding-parallel  thrusting  (Figure  28D  and  28F)  or  as  distinct  cross-cutting  faults  (Figure  28H). Antiformal structures and competency contrasts have a second-order control on gold  mineralization  in  the  Siguiri  district. High  vein  densities  are  commonly  focused  in  antiformal  closures (such as in the Kami and Sintroko deposit (Figure 19E, 23A, 28B, 28F). We infer fluid  flow was focused into antiformal fold hinges, with possible shale rich units acting as local seals  to  fluid  flow,  such  as  in  Sintroko  PB1  (Figure  19E,  28E). Whilst  the  V3B  veins  have  the  appearance in section of occurring along the F2S axial plane, they are actually oblique to this  trend and cross cut the F2S axial planes (Figure 28E). || Fieldwork was undertaken in eleven deposits of the Siguiri district. Particular attention  was  given  to  the  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti  deposits  due  to  their  structural  complexity,  lithostratigraphic  position,  outcropping  conditions  and  accessibility. Work  was  focused  on  structural  mapping,  lithofacies  recognition,  core  logging,  geochemical  sampling, GIS and 3D modelling. In addition to the data collected in the Siguiri district, regional  fieldwork was also carried out in the rest of the Siguiri Basin for geochronological sampling and  regional mapping. Regional  and  district  scale  geochronological  sampling  and  lithofacies  observations  indicate  that  the  central  Siguiri  Basin  is  of  Lower  Tarkwa  Group  age  (ca. 2015  Ma)  and  deposited  late  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Kami, Mikata County, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan<br><b>Pages:</b> 107,108,110,112,117,123,34,86,88,95,96,5<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Aspy: arsenopyrite, Qtz: quartz. Stereograms: S0 in black, mined veins as red great circles, mined vein  fold axes as red poles and S4S in green; equal angle (Wulff) projection. Gold in the ankerite-pyrite veins is found as free gold along fractures in the sulfides or  as  inclusions  displaying  triangular  textures  and  is  associated  with  chalcopyrite,  hematite  and  minor  chlorite  (Figure  23F). || Figure 7: Field photographs of (A) ripple marks in the Kami deposit, Fatoya formation; (B) rip-up clasts of shale at the  base of a turbidite (greywacke) bed in the Fatoya formation; (C) cm to dm-thick bedded greywacke turbidites in the  Fatoya  formation  associated  with  basal  erosional  (scour)  surfaces  (white  arrows);(D)  basal  conglomerate  of  the  Kintinian  formation  showing  the  polymict,  poorly-sorted,  angular  to  sub-rounded  clasts  dominated  by  greywacke/shale interbeds and shale (likely sourced from the Balato and Fatoya formations). The Fatoya Formation is dominated by normally-graded (fining-upward), dm to m-thick  beds  of  medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  grading  upwards  to  siltstone  and  mudstone  (Figure 5C, 5D, 6B). Beds are highlighted by sharp to erosional (scoured) basal surfaces (Figure  6D and 7C). Sub-angular to sub-rounded rip-up clasts of siltstone, mudstone and shale can be  observed  in  some  instances  (Figure  7B),  suggesting  that  the  fining-upward  greywacke  beds  were the product of erosional flows. High to low-angle cross-lamination is commonly observed  highlighting  the  deposition of current ripples in lower flow  regime  conditions (Figure  6B and  6D). Asymmetric ripple marks are also observed in the field (Figure  7A). || Sample  KMRCDD113  224.5,  meta-greywacke  (WGS84,  UTM  29N,  East.:  461552,  North.:  1277874, Elev.: 400 m)  This  sample  is  a  massive,  coarse-grained  dark  grey  feldspathic  greywacke  (~50  vol%  matrix)  at  sub-greenschist  facies  from  the  Fatoya  Formation  (Kami  deposit). Its  modal  composition  is  similar  to  sample  SKRCDD040  236.5  (20  vol%  quartz,  25  vol%  albite,  20  vol%  white  micas)  and  traces  of  pyrite  were  also  found. Zircon  yield  from  Geotrack  Pty  Ltd  was  abundant and the average crystal size was 60x80 μm. The zircons are mostly colourless or pale  brown, subhedral and heavily fractured. CL imaging shows that grains exhibit oscillatory zoning  (Figure 11F). The sample was mounted and dated on two separate mounts and over two sessions. || The  domes  and  basins  most  notably  developed  in  the  Kami  deposit,  could  therefore  have  developed  by  overprinting  of  the  F2S  N-S  folds  by  the  D4S  NW-SE  compression. The  V3B  mineralized veins located in these domes suggest that these domes developed pre- to syn-D3S  veining and thus cannot have formed by F2S/F4S interference. However, D4S may have amplified  the domes and basins. The S4S  dip angle and dip  direction varies  across the Siguiri district, from sub-vertical  and ESE- to WNW-dipping in the south, to shallowly SE-dipping in the north. Variations in S4S  dip angle and dip direction in the northern part of the district are interpreted to be related to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  the  rotation  of  cleavage  trajectories  around  these  structures,  a  mechanism described by Dewey et al. (1998). || The  en-echelon  veins  are  typically  thinner  and  rarely  exceed 4 centimeters in thickness. The en-echelon vein arrays can extend over 2-3 meters, but  individual  veins  typically  extend  for  up  to  50  centimeters. This  oldest  vein  set  is  not  mineralized. The  veins,  the  open  folds in  Kami and  the  F2S  syncline  in  Kosise  are  crosscut by  sub- vertical  discrete  shear  zones,  or  by  what  have  been  defined  as  incipient  structures. For  example,  a  meter-wide  discrete  NE-SW  fault  zone  displaying  dextral  kinematics  is  a  major  structural feature observed in the Kosise deposit (Figure 24C, 24D and 24E) and vein patterns  along minor E-W  trending fault zones  in the  Kami deposit  indicate  normal movements along  these  discrete  structures. However,  incipient  structures  are  more  common  than  discrete  structures in the Kosise and Kami deposits, and are expressed by an abundance of veins along  a 10 to 15 meters-wide damage zone of sheet-like geometry with no visible discrete zone of  faulting  or  shearing  (Figure  24B). || which  are  the  dominant  lithology  in  the  Fatoya  Formation. Six  extra  samples  of  Fatoya  greywacke  were  collected  from  the  Kami  deposit  (hole  KMRCDD293). Six  samples  were  also  collected from hole SKRCDD040 in the Sintroko PB1 deposit (Figure 35C). This hole intersects  the  Balato  Formation  only. Sampling  was  focused  on  both  shale  and  fine  greywacke  beds  within  and  ~75  m  away  from  the  main  ore  zone  (samples  SK1  to  SK6;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices).

It is made of two  distinct  terranes:  the  Archean  Kénéma-Man  domain  to  the  south-west,  and  the  Paleoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (Figure  1A). The  Archean  domain  is  dominated  by  gneiss  dated  between  ca. 3540  and  2750  Ma  (Kouamelan  et  al.,  1997;  Thiéblemont  et  al.,  2001) while the Paleoproterozoic domain displays an assemblage of volcano-sedimentary belts  and felsic intrusives, ranging in age from ca. 2250 to 2040 Ma (Davis et al., 2015; Parra-Avila,  2015;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2013). A  large  part  of  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  is  overlain  unconformably  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  Basin  (Begg  et  al.,  2009;  Lawrence et al., 2013a; Villeneuve and Cornée, 1994). || Kénéma-Man  domain,  in  the  south-west  of  the  West  African  Craton,  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny (ca. 2100-2000 Ma; Abouchami et al., 1990; Egal et al. 2002; Thiéblemont et al. 2004).

Alteration  Comparison  between  least  altered  samples  and  mineralized  samples  of  each  rock  types and in each formation allow for the characterization of the suite of elements enriched or  depleted towards the ore zones. In the Kintinian conglomerate (Figure 42B), mineralisation is  associated with major increases in Au, Ba, Bi, Cu, K, Rb, S, Te, W, Zn, minor increases in F, Fe,  Mg,  Ni,  Sn  and  minor  decreases  in  As  and  Na  compared  to  the  least  altered  conglomerate  sample (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Geochemical variations linked to mineralisation in  the  Fatoya  shale  beds  are  associated with major  increases  in  Au,  As,  Bi,  Na,  S, Te, W, minor  increases in Ag, Cu, Sr and decreases in Ba, K, P, Rb, Zn (Figure  42C). || The  Saraya  area  is  located  ~50  km  west  of  the  Siguiri  district  (area  around  sample  Si327 on Figure  3B). The  lithostratigraphy in the Saraya  area is similar to that of the district,  displaying  fine  micaceous  greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale  beds  alike  of  those  of  the  Balato,  Fatoya and Kintinian Formations. In AEM, the Saraya area shows a low response similar to that  of the Fatoya Formation. The Saraya metasediments are however overlain unconformably by  67 || The  axial  surface  of this  F2S  syncline  is  upright  but  no  planar  fabric parallel to it was observed   In  the  Kintinian  Formation  there  are  a  few  veins  (~1  vol%)  striking  to  the  NE  and  dipping  steeply  to  the  SE  that  crosscut  the  conglomerate  beds. These  veins  are  thin  (2-3  centimeters on average) but can extend over a few meters in length. In the Sanu Tinti deposit,  the faulted contact between the Kintinian and the Fatoya Formations is marked by brecciated  textures developed in the first few meters around the fault. The fault is oriented N-S to NNE- SSW, dips moderately to the SE and has been delineated to a depth of more than 300 meters  (Figure 18A). Slickensides indicate that this contact is a thrust fault. In the Fatoya Formation, a  poorly defined and spaced planar fabric trends to the NNE and moderately dips to the WNW. || The  stacked  conglomerates  sitting  near  its  base  are  interpreted  as  the  products  of  subaqueous,  cohesive  debris  flows  (Mulder  and  Alexander,  2001). They incorporated relatively local clasts, as highlighted by the clast angularity, sorting  and the along-strike variations in their origin. This is exemplified by the shale-dominated clasts  eroded along the marine (or lake) slope  from the older Balato and Fatoya Formations in the  Siguiri  district  while  limestone  clasts  dominates  in the  conglomerates  observed  closer to  the  Marble Hill location. The rest of the Kintinian is interpreted as a return to a low energy marine  or lake depositional setting with fluctuating water geochemistry and conditions at the origin of  the organic-rich shales / limestone interbeds (Figure 6F). Overall,  the  Siguiri  district  sediments  are  interpreted  as  marine  or  lake  sedimentary  deposits. They  initially  form  a  regressive  (coarsening-upward)  sequence  showing  a  transition  from (Figure 9):   1) low-energy marine (or lake) organic-rich shales (lower Balato Formation);   2) onset of gravity-flow deposits and distal turbidite deposition (possibly turbidite lobe  complex including distributary channel fills), and;   81 || The basal Kintinian olistostrome marks the interface between the Fatoya and Kintinian  Formations and can be traced in regional magnetic datasets and by field mapping as a narrow  N-S belt across the entire Siguiri Basin (Figure 10). The prominence of this N-S trend in other  major volcano-sedimentary belts across the West African Craton, parallel to the central Siguiri  Basin (e.g. Yanfolila Belt; Figure 3A), indicates probable basement structure reactivation. Bends  in  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  and  in  the  rest  of  the  lithostratigraphy  defined  in  the  Siguiri  district  can  be  observed  both  at  the  scale  of  the  district  (Figure  5)  and  at  the  regional  scale  where  the  olistostrome  forms  a  “Z”-shaped  unit  recognized  across  the  entire  Siguiri  Basin  (Figure  3B  and  10). The  peculiar  shape  of  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  recognized  across  the  Siguiri Basin originated from the first phases of orogenic contraction affecting the Basin, such  as  D1S  N-S  compression. The  WNW-ESE,  N-S  and  NE-SW  structures  that  bound  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  across  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Figure  3B,  5  and  10)  are  therefore  considered  to  represent  fundamental  deeper  basement  structures  that  controlled  the  thickness  and  morphology of this unit at the time of its deposition. || The third hydrothermal event is also represented by a distinct texture,  only  observed  in  the  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti  deposits. The  mineralisation  texture  found  in  the  Kintinian  polymict  conglomerate  is  represented  by  disseminated  pyrite,  accompanied  by  tourmaline,  rare  monazite  and  traces  of  late chalcopyrite, sphalerite,  hematite  and  ilmenite. Minor  sericitisation  and  carbonate  alteration  is  also  associated  with  this  mineralisation  texture. This disseminated mineralisation shows some degree of structural control (Kintinian- Fatoya  N-S  thrust  contact)  but  is  mainly  stratigraphically  controlled  by  the  Kintinian  conglomerate. Comparison  of  major  and  trace  element  signatures  by  LA-ICP-MS  and  EPMA  between the disseminated pyrite and the other generations of pyrite associated with D2S, D3S  and  D4S  deformation  indicates  that  the  Sanu  Tinti  disseminated  pyrite  presents  geochemical  196 || These  deposits  are  spread  along  an  average  WNW-ESE  trend  across  the  three  different  sedimentary  Formations  hosting  the  district:  the  Kintinian,  Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  (Figure 2; Watts, 2010). Fieldwork was undertaken in all these deposits but the greater part of  the  work  was  focused  on  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti. This  choice  was  based on the:   1)  importance of the gold mineralisation in the deposit;  2)  hosting Formation;   3)  proximity to contact with another Formation;   4)  outcropping quality of the deposit, and;   5)  density of drill cores in the deposit. 34 || Whole-rock multi-element geochemistry  Baseline geochemistry  Comparison of the baseline geochemistry for the least altered samples of all three rock  types  (conglomerate,  shale  and  greywacke)  from  each  three  formations  hosting  the  Siguiri  district indicates that most elements have similar concentrations in all rock types of all three  formations (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). However, when data from the Kintinian, Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  are  normalised  to  a  sample  representative  of  the  dominant  lithology  found  in  the  Siguiri  district  (least  altered  greywacke  from  Kosise  in  the  Fatoya  Formation),  variations  in  a  suite  of  elements  can  be  observed  (Figure  42A). The  baseline  geochemical  variations between the three formations are also observed when comparing the geochemistry  of all collected samples (least altered and altered; Figure 43). In  particular,  baseline  geochemistry  of  the  Kintinian  Formation  is  associated  with  increased concentrations of Ca, F, Li, Mg, Ni, Sc, Sn, Sr, U, V (+ minor increases in Ga and W)  and decreased concentrations of As, Cu, Pr, Si and Zr when compared to the Fatoya and Balato  Formations (Figure 43; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Baseline geochemistry of the Balato  Formation,  when  compared  to  those  for  the  Kintinian  and  Fatoya  Formations,  is  associated  with a marked increase in Ba, minor increases in concentration of Bi, Cu, Hf, Pr, Sr, Th, Zn, Zr  and  a  minor  decrease  in  Ge  (Figure  43;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices). These  variations  shows  that  the  Balato  Formation  differs  geochemically  mainly  from  the  Kintinian  Formation  (Figure  42A  and  43). || affinities with D3S and D4S pyrite associated with the V3B veins and the S4S cleavage, respectively  (Figure 45). Since petrographic observations indicate that the Sanu Tinti disseminated pyrite is  overprinted by the S4S cleavage, we propose that both V3B and Sanu Tinti disseminated pyrite  formed coevally late during D3S. Both mineralisation textures developed along the early-D3S N-S  thrust  at  the  contact  between  the  Kintinian  and  the  Fatoya  Formation. The  change  in  mineralisation texture from the Fatoya to the Kintinian Formation is common in orogenic gold  deposits (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Groves, 1993) and interpreted  to  be  linked  to  the  higher  porosity  and  lower  competency  of  the  Kintinian  conglomerate  compared  to  the  sediments  of  the  Fatoya  Formation. The  second  and  main  episode  of  gold  mineralisation  identified  in  Siguiri  was  found  to  be  associated  with  both  mineralisation  textures. In the V3B vein-hosted mineralisation, gold was found in the veins and in the lattice of  the arsenopyrite crystals (up to 55.5 ppm Au; Figure 45; Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). || sedimentation. However, available data show that the Kintinian conglomerates occur as thick  (~10-15 m) deposits overlain by thin (<50 cm) shale to mudstone intervals. The conglomerates  were observed at  the contact  with Fatoya greywackes, above  a thrust  fault in the  Sanu Tinti  deposit, and reworking meta-limestone/marble in drill cores from the Silakoro area. Based on  the  current  data,  the  conglomeratic  layers  sit  near  the  base  of  the  Kintinian  Formation,  are  overlain  by  mudstone  and  boudinaged  limestone  interbeds  representing  the  bulk  of  the  Kintinian Formation (Figure 6F), and their true thickness varies across the map and in cores. In  order  to  integrate  the  observations  from  the  Siguiri  district  in  the  broader  Siguiri  basin  framework,  two  additional  localities  were  investigated: the  Marble  Hill  and  the  Saraya  area  (Figure  3B  and  5A). Located  between  the  Kintinian  and  the  Fatoya  Formations  in  map  view  (area  around  sample  Si241  on  Figure  5A),  the  Marble  Hill  displays  conglomerate  and  greywacke sitting on top of strongly foliated meta-limestone beds (Figure 6D). || therefore interpreted as a marine or deep lake sequence formed by turbidity current deposits. The relatively fine-grained, thin-bedded turbidites suggest a rather distal depositional setting,  such  as  the  outer  part  of  a  channel-levee  system  (Piper  and  Deptuck,  1997)  and/or  a  distal  turbidite lobe setting (e.g. Gervais et al., 2006; Bourget et al., 2010). In contrast, the presence  of  thick  beds  (up  to  ~5  m-thick)  of  massive  medium  to  fine-grained  greywacke  in  drill  cores  suggest  deposition  in  a  low-relief,  channelized  depositional  environment  such  as  lobe  distributaries  (Gervais  et  al.,  2006;  Bourget  et  al.,  2010). The  meta-limestone/marbles,  reworked  by  the  Kintinian  conglomerates,  are  interpreted  to  lay  at  the  top  of  the  Fatoya  Formation or base of the Kintinian Formation.

The crystal lattice of the disseminated pyrite was however found to be  barren (~3 ppm Au maximum; Figure 45; Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). The  last  hydrothermal  event  is  a  late  overprint,  which  developed  during  D4S  NW-SE  compression and formed the S4S cleavage. This cleavage is characterised by strain shadows of  sericite, quartz, ankerite and albite around V3B arsenopyrite crystals. Chlorite, hematite, pyrite,  chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, magnetite can also be found in these strain shadows or in  veinlets  overprinting  the  syn-V3B  disseminated  pyrite  in  the  Kintinian  conglomerate. Even  though no significant gold was found locked in syn-D4S pyrite (~3 ppm Au maximum), free gold  has  been  described  in  both  Bidini  and  Kosise  deposits  infilling  fractures  or  strain  shadow  of  early  mineralised  V3B  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite  with  chalcopyrite,  hematite  and  galena. || supported  by  other  studies  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006;  Price  and  Pichler,  2006). Variations  in  As  content also have a direct impact on the unit cell parameters of the pyrite crystal lattice (a, b, c  distances between atoms and α, β, γ angles between a, b and c) which affects the capacity of  this  mineral  to  contain  gold  (Large  et  al.,  2011;  Savage  et  al.,  2000). This  conclusion  is  highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite:  more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure  45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for  the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the  Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit.

Fieldwork and sampling  In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  identified  in  the  previous  section,  fieldwork  was  conducted in and around the Siguiri district. A total of 22 weeks were spent in the field over  the  course  of  this  study. Fieldwork  was  focused  on  geological  and  structural  mapping,  core  logging and sampling in the  different  deposits of the district  but  was  also conducted around  the district and outside of the Siguiri Basin. Thirteen deposits from the Siguiri district were accessible over the course of this study. From  south  to  north:  Sintroko  PB1,  Sintroko  PB2C,  Sintroko  PB3A,  Sintroko  North,  Kosise,  Kami, Kozan, Kalamagna PB1, Tubani, Bidini, Sanu Tinti, Eureka North and Seguelen (Figure 2). || ANTITAXIAL  V3B  QUARTZ-ANKERITE-ARSENOPYRITE  VEIN;  G)  NATIVE  GOLD  IN  AN  ANTITAXIAL  V3B  QUARTZ-ANKERITE- ARSENOPYRITE  VEIN  OVERPRINTING  A  V2S  QUARTZ-(CARBONATE)  VEIN.

LOCATIONS OF THE DRILL HOLES  AND COLLECTED SAMPLES HIGHLIGHTED. || D1S deformation is interpreted to have been linked to N-S compression, but with inconclusive  outcrop exposures the understanding of this early deformation remains unclear. An alternative  interpretation is that the F1S folds represent syn-sedimentary slump folds (McClay, 1992), but  the  consistent  orientation  and  fold  axes  (accounting  for  overprinting  by  subsequent  events)  more  strongly  supports  a  tectonic  contractional  setting  for  this  folding. This  first  phase  of  deformation  may  be  responsible  for  the  early  albitisation  of  the  host  rock  across  the  Siguiri  district. D2S:  The second deformation is associated with the formation of major folds (F2S) and  associated D2S thrust faults (e.g., at Sanu Tinti and Kosise; Figure  18A and 18C). This event is  responsible for the bulk of the folding in the metasedimentary rocks and for the N-S structural  grain affecting much of the Siguiri Basin. F2S fold axial planes typically strike NNE-SSW to NNW- SSE,  and  their  fold  axes  plunge  at  variable  angles,  and  are  typically  steeper  in  the  Balato  Formation compared to the Fatoya Formation. || Figure  35:  Simplified  structural  maps  and  cross-sections  of  key  deposits  from  the  Siguiri  district  (location  map  on  Figure 33). A) Sanu Tinti and Bidini; B) Kosise, and; C) Sintroko PB1. Locations of the drill holes and collected samples  highlighted. Fatoya Formation sediments in the Bidini deposit display various sedimentary features  that can be used as way-up indicators, such as: cross-bedding, rip-up clasts and ripple marks. Metre-thick  beds  of  medium  grained  greywacke  and  sandstone  dominate,  however  fine  alternations of siltstone and shale can also be occasionally found, as well as some black shale  layers. In  this  deposit,  the  Fatoya  Formation  is  overlying  up  to  100  m  of  conglomerate  interbeds, intersected in core BDRCDD009 (Figure 35A and 36). || Gold  mineralisation  in  the  Kami  and  Kosise  deposits  is  associated  with  veins  that  crosscut the oldest quartz-dominated vein sets and developed adjacent to discrete fault zones  and  also  with  veins  within  damage  zones  related  to  incipient  structures. The  vein  arrays  occurring adjacent to the discrete fault zones and within the damage zones, can be separated  into  two  generations. The first  generation  of  these  veins  consists  of  ankerite-pyrite  and  rare  albite,  and  was  only  observed  in  drill  core  and  develops  in  the  first  few  meters  around  the  damage zone linked to the discrete fault zones (Figure 20B and 20C). These veins orientation  could  only  be  constrained  from  drill  core  observation,  and  do  not  show  a  consistent  orientation  (Figure  20B). These  veins  are  a  few  millimeters  up  to  15  centimeters  thick  and  commonly display brecciated textures (Figure 20B). Their lateral extent is not known. || In  Kosise,  the  former  orientation  displays  an  en-echelon  geometry  (Figure  20A). In  the  Kosise  deposit,  the  V2S  vein  poles  typically  plot  along  an  E-W  oriented  girdle,  consistent  with  the  prominent  F2S  folding  event  (stereogram on  Figure  20A). The V2S bedding parallel veins, and also the en-echelon sigmoidal vein sets, are interpreted to  indicate  some  amount  of  flexural  slip  along  bedding  occurred  during  late-stage  F2S  fold  development  (Figure  20A  and  27). Based  on  all  early  and  late-D2S  structural  elements  presented (Figure 17 and 18C), we interpret that D2S was associated with an E-W to ESE-WNW  compressional stress-field under a brittle-ductile regime. Figure 27: Schematic evolution of the early-D2S compression and of the mode of formation of the bedding parallel  and en-echelon V2S veins associated with flexural slip. 131 || In the field, veins from one set can be  found  conjugate  with  veins  from  the  other,  or  with  other  secondary  veins  with  a  slightly  differently orientation (Figure 23B). In the first ten to fifteen meters away from these damage  zones  the  conjugate  vein  sets  can  also  be  found  in  domal  structures  along  particularly  competent  greywacke  beds  (Figure  23A). The  bulk of  the  gold  found  in  the  Kami  and  Kosise  deposits is associated with these quartz-ankerite-arsenopyrite veins. Native gold can be found  in the quartz veins and along the ankerite rims. Free gold can also be found in the arsenopyrite  and  along  fractures  associated  with  chalcopyrite,  galena  and  some  sphalerite. Gold  grades  125 || Instead  it  is  located  in  the  center  of  a  large  sedimentary basin in the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain of the West African Craton. The Siguiri gold district  currently  consists of eleven accessible deposits, and is the only  large  gold  district  (>  50  t  Au)  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  rocks  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Egal  et  al.,  1999). Previous work on the district have recognized grade trends but have struggled to put  the geology together and highlight the incipient structures that control gold mineralization at a  deposit,  district  and  regional-scale. Most  notably,  a  study  on  the  structural  controls  of  auriferous quartz veining in eight of the deposits of the district was conducted by Steyn (2012). Steyn (2012) concluded that mineralization is hosted by veins, mainly controlled by competent  lithologies  and  associated  with  N-S  to  NW-SE  fold  hinges  and  N-S  to  NE-SW  shear  zones  developed during  ENE-WSW  transpression. This paper  builds onto the observations made  by  Steyn (2012) and describes the different brittle, ductile and brittle-ductile structures observed  in  the  district,  including  the  different  vein  generations  from  five  representative  deposits  including Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. || Intersections between  NE-SW  dextral  shear  zones  and  N-S  thrust  faults  are  typically  highly  mineralized,  such  as  in  Kosise  (Figure  19C).

Bidini  The  Bidini  deposit  is  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the  district  (Figure  17). Bidini  is  hosted  in  the  greywacke-dominated  Fatoya  Formation,  and  is  adjacent  to  the  Sanu  Tinti  111 || Kosise  Lithostratigraphy and structure Kosise   The Kosise deposit is hosted by the Fatoya Formation and is located to the west of the  contact with the Balato Formation (Figure 33). Sedimentary beds in Kosise are typically a metre  thick and commonly display sedimentary features, such as graded bedding, ripple marks, rip- up  clasts  as  well  as  loading  and  cross-bedding  structures. These  sedimentary  features  were  used  as  way-up  indicators  and  show  that  the  Fatoya  Formation  in  this  deposit  is  normally  graded. Kosise lithostratigraphy is dominated by beds of medium to coarse-grained greywacke  and some beds of sandstone can also be found in the north of the deposit. Rare alternations of  thin siltstone and shale beds can also be found. Kosise  is located in a F2S  syncline  oriented N-S with a sub-horizontal fold axis (Figure  35B). || Methodology  Field approach and sampling  Field approach  Structural elements and controls on gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district are very  consistent  from  one  deposit  to the next  (Lebrun et al., in review  2015a; Chapter 3). For this  reason, key deposits were selected based on the formation and host rocks, the understanding  of the deposit structural framework, and the accessibility to fresh outcrops and core intersects. Three  deposits  were  identified  as  representative  of  the  Siguiri  district  mineralisation:  the  Bidini, Kosise and Sintroko PB1 deposits (Figure 33). General sampling  Sampling was designed to: 1) constrain the paragenesis of the district; 2) characterise  the geochemical halo associated with a representative mineralised shear zone; 3) compare the  geochemical changes between formations and host rocks, and; 4) compare the sulphide major  and trace elements and gold content of each vein generation and hydrothermal events. A total  of 37 representative fresh rock samples were collected. Due to the weathering profile reaching  depths  over  200  m,  drill  core  logging  was  conducted  and  used  to  guide  sampling. || Mineral assemblages and mineralisation  The  XRD  analyses  on  the  Kosise  samples  show  that  the  greywacke  host  rock  is  comprised of >40 vol% albite, 7 vol% carbonate, >5 vol% chamosite (chlorite family), 15 vol%  white micas and 27 vol% quartz. In the shale beds chamosite and white mica increase to 8 vol%  and 28 vol%, respectively and quartz decreases to 17 vol%. These abundances vary by only a  few percent across the ore shoots (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). The V2S en-echelon veins  crosscut the already albitised and sericitised host rock. In Kosise, these veins are dominated by  quartz with rare ankerite and albite. No free gold was observed in V2S pyrite. || Mineralisation footprints and regional timing of the  Siguiri orogenic gold district (Guinea, West  Africa)  Erwann Lebrun1, Nicolas Thébaud1, John Miller1, Malcolm Roberts2, Noreen Evans3  1: Centre for Exploration Targeting and ARC Centre of Excellence for Core to Crust Fluid Systems,  School  of  Earth  and  Environment,  Robert  Street  Building,  M006,  The  University  of  Western  Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA, 6009,  Australia  2: Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis, M010, The University of Western Australia,  35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia  3:  John  de  Laeter  Centre  for  Isotope  Research,  TIGeR,  Department  of  Applied  Geology,  Curtin  University, Perth, WA 6845, Australia  Abstract:  Siguiri  is  a  world-class  orogenic  gold  district  hosted  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  Upper  Birimian  to  Lower  Tarkwa  Group  sediments  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Guinea). The  district  is  characterized by a protracted deformation history associated with four main deformation events:  D1S  is  a  N-S  compression;  D2S  is  an  E-W  compression  progressively  evolving  into  an  early-D3S  transpression  and  then  into  a  late-D3S  NNW-SSE  transtension,  and  D4S  is  a  NE-SW  compression. Field observations, petrography and chemical analyses applied to three key deposits of the Siguiri  district  (Bidini,  Sintroko  PB1  and  Kosise)  suggest  that  the  hydrothermal  activity  in  the  district  is  polyphase  and  can  be  subdivided  into  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. The  first  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  barren  bedding-parallel  and  en-echelon  V2S  quartz- dominated-(pyrite) veins. The second hydrothermal event is characterised by the development of  V3A  pyrite-ankerite  veins  late  during  D3S. Laser  ablation  data  show  that  this  vein  set  contains  an  anomalous gold content  of up to 43.3 ppm locked in its pyrite crystal lattice. || Native gold can be found within the quartz or on the margin of the quartz and ankerite (Figure  20E). Kami and Kosise  The  Kami  and  Kosise  deposits  are  both  hosted  in  the  Fatoya  Formation,  which  is  dominated by meter-thick greywacke-sandstone beds fining up into, or alternating with, minor  centimeter-thick  beds  of  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  17). Kami  sits  in  the  centre  of  the  Formation, whereas Kosise sits further to the east. The  Kami  deposit  has  a  structural  style  characterized  by  open  F1S  upright  folds  with  fold  axes  gently  plunging  to  the  NE  or  the  SW  and  by  open  F2S  upright  folds  with  fold  axes  gently  plunging  to  the  north  or  south. The  intersection  of  these  folds  forms  a  broad  domal  structure that hosts the Kami deposit. The Kosise deposit is adjacent to Kami and is hosted on  the hinge and short limb of an open N-S F2S syncline which has a sub-horizontal fold axis. || ON THE PHOTOGRAPHS, BEDDING IS REPRESENTED BY FULL BLACK LINES, FOLD AXIAL PLANES BY SHORT-DASHED  BLACK  LINES  AND  SHEAR  ZONE  BOUNDARIES  BY  LONG-DASHED  BLACK  LINES.

The  only  N-S  damage  zone  recognized  in  Kosise  is  sub- parallel to the stratigraphy and extends to the Kozan deposit, which displays similar structural  features  (Figure  17  and  19D).

Campbell McCuaig1  1:  Centre  for  Exploration  Targeting  and  ARC  Centre  of  Excellence  for  Core  to  Crust  Fluid  Systems,  School  of  Earth  and  Environment,  Robert  Street  Building,  M006,  The  University  of  Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA, 6009,  Australia  2: AngloGold Ashanti Ltd - Assets Development - Brownfields, 44 St George Terrace, Perth, WA,  6000, Australia  Abstract:  Ore  bodies  in  the  Siguiri  district,  a  world-class  Paleoproterozoic  orogenic  gold  camp  located  in  the  Birimian  of  north-eastern  Guinea,  are  typically  represented  by  cryptic  sub- vertical  damage  zones  only  expressed  by  a  high  density  of  mineralized  veins. Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || The  en-echelon  veins  are  typically  thinner  and  rarely  exceed 4 centimeters in thickness. The en-echelon vein arrays can extend over 2-3 meters, but  individual  veins  typically  extend  for  up  to  50  centimeters. This  oldest  vein  set  is  not  mineralized. The  veins,  the  open  folds in  Kami and  the  F2S  syncline  in  Kosise  are  crosscut by  sub- vertical  discrete  shear  zones,  or  by  what  have  been  defined  as  incipient  structures. For  example,  a  meter-wide  discrete  NE-SW  fault  zone  displaying  dextral  kinematics  is  a  major  structural feature observed in the Kosise deposit (Figure 24C, 24D and 24E) and vein patterns  along minor E-W  trending fault zones  in the  Kami deposit  indicate  normal movements along  these  discrete  structures. However,  incipient  structures  are  more  common  than  discrete  structures in the Kosise and Kami deposits, and are expressed by an abundance of veins along  a 10 to 15 meters-wide damage zone of sheet-like geometry with no visible discrete zone of  faulting  or  shearing  (Figure  24B). || These  deposits  are  spread  along  an  average  WNW-ESE  trend  across  the  three  different  sedimentary  Formations  hosting  the  district:  the  Kintinian,  Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  (Figure 2; Watts, 2010). Fieldwork was undertaken in all these deposits but the greater part of  the  work  was  focused  on  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti. This  choice  was  based on the:   1)  importance of the gold mineralisation in the deposit;  2)  hosting Formation;   3)  proximity to contact with another Formation;   4)  outcropping quality of the deposit, and;   5)  density of drill cores in the deposit. 34 || These  deposits  highlight  critical  components of character of the host rocks, host rock controls on mineralization and also key  structural  features  with  different  relative  timing. The  five  deposits  selected  for  detailed  analysis were, from north to south: Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. The Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini  and  Kosise  deposits  are  all  located  near  or  at  the  contact  between  two  of  the  110 || These  structures,  which  cut  across  F2S  folds  (Figure  28D  and  28E),  are  expressed  differently  across  the  Siguiri  district. Most  of  these  are  incipient  faults,  and  expressed  as  damage  zones  around  incipient  structures such as in Kosise (Figure 28D), delineated by zones of dense veining (Figure 28C and  28F). These damage zones are cryptic and therefore difficult to recognize on the field and in  geophysics  but  based  on  their  regular  orientation,  could  be  linked  to  fundamental  deeper  137 || This  stress-field  is  compatible  with  the  mapped  N-S  thrust  faults,  and  with  the  E-W  normal  faults. In  this  model,  D2S  E-W  compression  forms  F2S  folds  with  N-S  trending  axial  planes  and  N-S  thrust  faults  that  may  have  collectively  developed  local  N-S  trending  extension,  accommodated  by  E-W  normal  faults. However,  the  later  strike-slip  structures  that  transect  the  F2S  folds and also control V3S  veining, such as the  NE-SW dextral  shear  zone  in  Kosise,  require  σ3  to  have  been  horizontal. We  interpret  that  from  D2S  to  D3S  there was a switch in the orientation of σ3 from vertical to low angle. This change is thought to  be responsible for the formation of the dextral NE-SW shear zones, sinistral WNW-ESE faults as  well  as  the  E-W  normal  faults. The  V3S  veins  are  interpreted  to  be  part  of  this  event. || Whole-rock major and trace element geochemical analyses  Whole-rock  major  and  trace  element  compositions  were  measured  on  each  sample  collected  from  Bidini,  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1. The  aim  was  to  identify  1)  the  different  geochemical  variations  associated  with  mineralisation  between  the  three  sedimentary  formations hosting the Siguiri district, and; 2) the main geochemical differences between these  formations. Geochemical analyses (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices) were carried out by Intertek  Genalysis Laboratories in Perth, using a combination of analytical techniques detailed in Table  6 in Electronic Appendices. The Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Bunbury basalt  and Kerba granite standards were included to monitor instrument precision. Data precision for  both  standards  was  typically  within  3%  for  major  elements  and  10%  for  trace  elements. Detection  limits  for  each  element  are  provided  in  Table  6  in  Electronic  Appendices. || Whole-rock multi-element geochemistry  Baseline geochemistry  Comparison of the baseline geochemistry for the least altered samples of all three rock  types  (conglomerate,  shale  and  greywacke)  from  each  three  formations  hosting  the  Siguiri  district indicates that most elements have similar concentrations in all rock types of all three  formations (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). However, when data from the Kintinian, Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  are  normalised  to  a  sample  representative  of  the  dominant  lithology  found  in  the  Siguiri  district  (least  altered  greywacke  from  Kosise  in  the  Fatoya  Formation),  variations  in  a  suite  of  elements  can  be  observed  (Figure  42A). The  baseline  geochemical  variations between the three formations are also observed when comparing the geochemistry  of all collected samples (least altered and altered; Figure 43). In  particular,  baseline  geochemistry  of  the  Kintinian  Formation  is  associated  with  increased concentrations of Ca, F, Li, Mg, Ni, Sc, Sn, Sr, U, V (+ minor increases in Ga and W)  and decreased concentrations of As, Cu, Pr, Si and Zr when compared to the Fatoya and Balato  Formations (Figure 43; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Baseline geochemistry of the Balato  Formation,  when  compared  to  those  for  the  Kintinian  and  Fatoya  Formations,  is  associated  with a marked increase in Ba, minor increases in concentration of Bi, Cu, Hf, Pr, Sr, Th, Zn, Zr  and  a  minor  decrease  in  Ge  (Figure  43;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices). These  variations  shows  that  the  Balato  Formation  differs  geochemically  mainly  from  the  Kintinian  Formation  (Figure  42A  and  43). || from V2S, V3A, V3B veins and syn-D4S all came from the Fatoya and Kintinian Formations (Kosise  and Bidini deposits). Small amounts of pyrite were found in the Balato Formation (Sintroko PB1  deposit) and could not be linked to any of the four generations. Samples of arsenopyrite came  from  the  Balato  and  Fatoya  Formations  (Sintroko  PB1  and  Bidini  deposits). Samples  were  separated according to the nature of their host rock (either greywacke, shale or conglomerate;  Table  5  in  Electronic  Appendices). Laser  ablation  was  used  to  provide  the  missing  links  between  the  different  textures  of  the  hydrothermal  mineral  assemblages  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district. In  particular,  laser  ablation  and  EPMA  data  allowed  the  comparison  of  the  major  and  trace  element  signatures  from  the  multiple  pyrite  generations  from  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1  and  the  pyrite  found  in  the  Bidini  conglomerate. || lattice  of  the  V3B  arsenopyrite  have  similar  Ag/Au  and  Ni/Co  ratios  to  all  pyrite  generations,  around 7.5 and 2.81 respectively (Figure 45E and 45I). In summary, while no arsenopyrite was  found in the Kintinian Formation, arsenopyrite from the Balato Formation shows enrichment in  Ag, Co, Cr, Cu, Sb, Ti (and minor Mn) and depletion in As when compared to the arsenopyrite  hosted in the Fatoya Formation (Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). Discussion  Polyphase hydrothermal activity and gold mineralisation  Field  observations  of  vein  cross-cutting  relationships,  core  logging  and  petrographic  descriptions from Bidini, Sintroko PB1 and Kosise, permit the construction of local paragenetic  sequences  for  each  individual  deposit  studied. When  compared  to  one  another,  the  local  paragenetic  sequences  are  homogeneous  across  the  Siguiri  district  and  are  characterised  by  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. These  events  were  correlated  in  the  district-scale  paragenetic sequence (Figure 46) summarized below. Together, the laser ablation data (Figure  45) and the general paragenetic  sequence of the district,  reflects  the polyphase  character of  gold mineralisation in Siguiri and three distinct gold mineralisation events were identified. || linked  to  mineralisation  in  the  Kintinian  Formation  shale  beds  are  associated  with  major  increases in Au, Ca, Na, S, Sr, W, minor increases in Mg, Pb, Sb and decreases in Ba, Cu, K, Rb  and  Zn  compared  to the  least  altered  shale  sample from  the  Fatoya  Formation  (Figure  42C). Geochemical  variations  linked  to  mineralisation  in  the  Balato  Formation  shale  beds  are  associated  with  major  increases  in  Au,  As,  Bi,  Cu,  F,  Fe,  Na,  Ni,  Sb,  Sn,  Sr,  Te,  W,  minor  increases in Mg and decreases in Ba, Ca, K, P, Pb, Rb, S, Th, U and Zn compared to the least  altered  shale  sample  from  this  formation  (Figure  42D). Comparison  of  the  geochemical  variations  between  the  altered  greywacke  from  the  Fatoya  Formation  and  the  least  altered  greywacke  from  the  same  formation  indicates  major  enrichments  in  Au,  Ag,  As,  Bi,  S,  Te,  W  and depletions in Ba, Ca, Cu, K, Mg associated with mineralisation (Figure  42E). Geochemical  alteration in the Kintinian Formation greywacke is characterised by enrichments in Au, Ca, F,  Mg,  Pb,  S,  Sn,  Sr,  W  and  depletions  in  As,  Bi,  Cu  and  Na  (Figure  42E). Comparison  of  the  geochemical  variations  between  the  altered  greywacke  from  the  Balato  Formation  and  the  least  altered  greywacke  from the  same  formation  indicates  major enrichments  in  Au,  As,  Bi,  Ca,  Pb,  S,  Sb,  Sr,  Te,  Zn,  minor  enrichments  in  K,  Rb,  Sn  and  depletions  in  Cu,  F,  P  and  W  associated with mineralisation (Figure 42F). In addition, high-grade zones in Kosise (some over 100 g.t-1 Au; Lebrun et al., in review  2015a; Chapter 3) are associated with a geochemical alteration halo at least 15 metres wide,  characterized by an increase towards the ore shoots in: Ag, Au, As, Bi, Co, Mo, Sb, Se, S, Te and  W (Figure 44 and Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). || shear  zone,  but  no  kinematic  indicators  were  identified. A  series  of  sub-vertical  incipient  structures oriented N-S, NE-SW and E-W also crosscut the F2S folds (Figure 18D). Like at Kami  and Kosise these cross cutting incipient structures are not characterised by any distinctive fault  plane  but  are  rather  expressed  as  a  damage  zone  defined  by  an  increase  in  vein  density  defining a planar zone 10-15 meters thick of dense veining (Figure 19E, 24A and 24B). Veining  associated with the damage zones is also preferentially developed in competent beds (Figure  24A  and  24B). The  veins  associated  with  the  damage  zones,  and  with  the  central  NNE-SSW  shear zones, display various orientations that can be grouped into two distinct conjugate sets. These vein sets  are oriented around 172/26 and 150/70. || that  controlled  the  location  of  the  Siguiri  district  within  the  sediments  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (dashed lines on Figure 16B). Two  vein  sets  were  recognized  along  all  these  faults,  V3A  and  V3B. The  first  set,  V3A  (Figure  20B  and  20C),  comprises  ankerite-pyrite-(albite). The  orientation  of  this  vein  set  is  poorly constrained but varies significantly around a 240/55 mean (in the Kosise and Seguelen  deposits; stereogram on Figure 20B). This orientation is sub-parallel to the WNW-ESE sinistral  structures. The V3A set were also observed close to NE-SW dextral shear zones in drill core and  are confined within the first tens of meters from these structures. || which  are  the  dominant  lithology  in  the  Fatoya  Formation. Six  extra  samples  of  Fatoya  greywacke  were  collected  from  the  Kami  deposit  (hole  KMRCDD293). Six  samples  were  also  collected from hole SKRCDD040 in the Sintroko PB1 deposit (Figure 35C). This hole intersects  the  Balato  Formation  only. Sampling  was  focused  on  both  shale  and  fine  greywacke  beds  within  and  ~75  m  away  from  the  main  ore  zone  (samples  SK1  to  SK6;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices). Geochemical sampling  Geochemical sampling was conducted in the Bidini, Kosise and Sintroko PB1 deposits. || yellow. From top-left to bottom right: recumbent F1S folds from A) Bidini (the trace of the observed axial planar S1S  cleavage  is  also  represented)  and  B)  Eureka  North;  C)  F2S  fold  in  Bidini;  D)  the  Kozan  F2S  syncline,  thought  to  be  structurally adjacent to the Kosise F2S syncline; E) upright F2S fold with steeply plunging fold axis from Sintroko PB1. Note the consistent orientation of the veins mined by locals (vertical cavities in wall) and the rheological control on  mineralization (seal cap of shales, in dark grey, with strong veining restricted to underlying sandstones). Numerous  veins  can  be  observed  to  develop  along  bedding  and  F2S  folds  in  Bidini  (Figure 20A). These veins, whose orientation varies across the deposit, are typically only a few  millimeters to 5 centimeters thick. Multiple sub-vertical damage zones, oriented NE-SW and N- S, crosscut the F2S folds and overprint the bedding parallel veins. || Instead  it  is  located  in  the  center  of  a  large  sedimentary basin in the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain of the West African Craton. The Siguiri gold district  currently  consists of eleven accessible deposits, and is the only  large  gold  district  (>  50  t  Au)  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  rocks  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Egal  et  al.,  1999). Previous work on the district have recognized grade trends but have struggled to put  the geology together and highlight the incipient structures that control gold mineralization at a  deposit,  district  and  regional-scale. Most  notably,  a  study  on  the  structural  controls  of  auriferous quartz veining in eight of the deposits of the district was conducted by Steyn (2012). Steyn (2012) concluded that mineralization is hosted by veins, mainly controlled by competent  lithologies  and  associated  with  N-S  to  NW-SE  fold  hinges  and  N-S  to  NE-SW  shear  zones  developed during  ENE-WSW  transpression. This paper  builds onto the observations made  by  Steyn (2012) and describes the different brittle, ductile and brittle-ductile structures observed  in  the  district,  including  the  different  vein  generations  from  five  representative  deposits  including Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Košiše, Tunjice, Kamnik, Upravna Enota Kamnik, 1241, Slovenia<br><b>Pages:</b> 100,107,108,109,110,112,115,116,118,122,124,142,152,153,155,156,158,16,168,170,171,174,178,20,34,86,88,95,96,88<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  overall  asymmetric  fold  geometry  indicates  a  vergence  to  the  west  (Figure  17C). No axial planar cleavage (S2S) was identified as being associated with this event. A switch to a phase of brittle deformation marks the end stage of the D2S event in the  Siguiri district and is associated with the development of V2S veining and D2S brittle faults. The  V2S vein set is the oldest observed vein set in the Siguiri district, and it is not mineralized. The  orientation of this quartz-(carbonate) set varies from 320/80 in Sintroko PB1, to 070/40, and  280/45  in  the  Kosise  deposit. || A  composite  geochemical  cross-section  across  damage  zones  from  the  Kosise  deposit,  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  is  associated  with  enrichments in Ag, Au, As, Bi, Co, Mo, Sb, Se, S, Te and W. Geochemical variations associated with  the ore shoots in the Siguiri district are consistent with petrographic observations and highlight an  albite-carbonate-sulphide-sericite alteration system. The  fourth  and  last  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  a  late  penetrative  S4S  cleavage  during  D4S  deformation. This  late  deformation  event  overprints  all  pre- existing hydrothermal events and is associated with the deposition of free gold, chalcopyrite and  galena along fractures in V3A pyrite and V3B pyrite and arsenopyrite. Mineral  and  geochemical  footprint  and  timing  of  the  gold  events  in  the  Siguiri  district,  when  compared  with  other  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton,  highlight  the  synchronicity  of  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri (syn-D3S and syn-D4S events) with other events of gold mineralisation in this  part  of  the  Craton,  such  as  the  early  Au-Sb-Bi-(Te-W)  mineralisation  at  the  Morila  deposit  in  Southeast Mali. Results support the idea that late Eburnean-age gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district and in the West African Craton as a whole, is polyphase and that economic post-D4S gold  mineralisation could be found in the Siguiri Basin. || Comparison  between  the  major  and  trace  element  signatures  of  pyrite  from  the  Fatoya and Kintinian Formations show variations in Co, ranging from below detection limit up  to  1962.3  ppm  in  the  Fatoya  Formation,  and  from  below  detection  limit  to  32.6  ppm  in  the  Kintinian Formation. Values for Ni range from below detection limit to 1248 ppm in the Fatoya  Formation, and from below detection limit to 57 ppm in the Kintinian Formation. Values for Cu  range  from below  detection limit to 3688 ppm in the  Fatoya Formation, to 2 ppm and 4393  ppm in the Kintinian Formation. In addition, laser ablation data shows that V3A pyrite hosted in  greywacke from the Kosise deposit (Fatoya Formation; Figure 45A) has gold grades up to 43.3  ppm,  while  the  other  pyrite  generations  do  not  reach  grades  higher  than  3  ppm  (the  three  higher values reported on Figure 45E were obtained from gold inclusions). In summary, pyrite  from the Fatoya Formation is associated with increased concentrations in As, Au, Co, Ni (and  minor Bi, Mn), and a depletion in Cr, Cu, S, Si, Sn, Zr when compared to the major and trace  element  signatures  of  pyrite  hosted  in  the  Kintinian  Formation  (Table  5  in  Electronic  Appendices). Moreover, the crystal lattice of the different generation of pyrite shares similar  Ag/Au and Ni/Co ratios, around 7.5 and 2.81 respectively (Figure 45E and 45I). || D3S:  Although formally separated into a third deformation event, D3S potentially marks  the progressive continuation of D2S. The difference is that the D2S event is dominated by plastic  deformation  related  to  folding,  whereas  the  D3S  event  is  linked  to  the  rocks  developing  a  network  of  D3S  faults  with  contrasting  kinematics  including  thrust  faults,  normal  faults,  and  strike-slip faults that extend sub-vertically to depths of more than 300 meters (constrained by  drilling; Figure 18). These D3S faults are typically not fully developed as discrete features, but  are  rather  expressed  as  sub-vertical  and  poorly  outlined  incipient  faults  or  planar  damage  zones  characterized  by  increased  density  of  quartz  veining  and  associated  alteration  haloes  that  crosscut  both  F2S  folds  and  V2S  veins  (Figure  24A  and  24B). Establishing  a  relative  chronology between the different D3S faults was not possible in the field. These D3S structures  include:   -  Thrust faults that are moderately dipping to sub-vertical and N-S-trending (e.g. in the  Kosise deposit). || Figure  18:  Detailed  structural  form  line  maps  of  the  A)  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti  deposits;  B)  Kami  deposit;  C)  Kosise  deposit, and; D) Sintroko PB1 deposit. Each map is accompanied by the deposit cross-section, denoted in red letters. Damage zones, distinct and incipient structures are all represented by a thick black line. Discrete folds occur in the southeastern part of the Bidini deposit (Figure 19A). These  gently  inclined  to  recumbent  folds  are  open  to  tight,  and  have  a  wavelength  of  about  15  meters and fold axes that plunge moderately to the WSW. These folds are associated with an  axial planar cleavage that trends NW-SE to N-S and dips shallowly to moderately to the WSW. || Figure  42:  Geochemical  spider-diagrams  of  the  A)  least  altered  samples  collected  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  normalised to least altered Fatoya greywacke sample (sample O, collected in the Kosise deposit), representative of  the  lithologies  hosting  the  bulk  of  the  mineralisation  in  Siguiri.

Two  mineralised  zones  were  identified (around samples J, K, L, M and samples A, B, C, D) and are in close proximity to shear zones and a thrust  fault  (Figure  42  and  43). The  main  mineralised  zone  (samples  J,  K,  L,  M)  is  associated  with  typical  orogenic  gold  enrichments  in  Au-As-Sb-Te and W. Each  geochemical  sample  was  normalised  to  the  corresponding  greywacke  or  shale least altered sample (O and F, respectively). The composite geochemical cross-sections also show enrichments  in Bi, Mo and S around the main mineralised zone (samples J, K, L, M).

After Chapter 3. Sampling  was  focused  in  these  five  key  deposits  and  organised  to  cover  the  main  lithotypes (greywacke, shale and conglomerate) inside and outside of the ore zones. Sampling  for  whole-rock  multi-element  geochemistry  was  focused  in  the  Kosise  deposit. For  more  details on sampling, see the methodology sections of Chapters two and four. Regional  fieldwork  was  first  conducted  in  the  first  hundred  kilometres  around  the  Siguiri  district. || In  the  disseminated  pyrite,  gold  was  found  free  along  fractures  associated  with  chalcopyrite,  hematite and galena. The crystal lattice of the disseminated pyrite was however found to be  barren (~3 ppm Au maximum; Figure 45; Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). The  last  hydrothermal  event  is  a  late  overprint,  which  developed  during  D4S  NW-SE  compression and formed the S4S cleavage. This cleavage is characterised by strain shadows of  sericite, quartz, ankerite and albite around V3B arsenopyrite crystals. Chlorite, hematite, pyrite,  chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, magnetite can also be found in these strain shadows or in  veinlets  overprinting  the  syn-V3B  disseminated  pyrite  in  the  Kintinian  conglomerate. Even  though no significant gold was found locked in syn-D4S pyrite (~3 ppm Au maximum), free gold  has  been  described  in  both  Bidini  and  Kosise  deposits  infilling  fractures  or  strain  shadow  of  early  mineralised  V3B  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite  with  chalcopyrite,  hematite  and  galena. || In  Kosise,  the  former  orientation  displays  an  en-echelon  geometry  (Figure  20A). In  the  Kosise  deposit,  the  V2S  vein  poles  typically  plot  along  an  E-W  oriented  girdle,  consistent  with  the  prominent  F2S  folding  event  (stereogram on  Figure  20A). The V2S bedding parallel veins, and also the en-echelon sigmoidal vein sets, are interpreted to  indicate  some  amount  of  flexural  slip  along  bedding  occurred  during  late-stage  F2S  fold  development  (Figure  20A  and  27). Based  on  all  early  and  late-D2S  structural  elements  presented (Figure 17 and 18C), we interpret that D2S was associated with an E-W to ESE-WNW  compressional stress-field under a brittle-ductile regime. Figure 27: Schematic evolution of the early-D2S compression and of the mode of formation of the bedding parallel  and en-echelon V2S veins associated with flexural slip. 131 || Samples  were collected from drill-core and the sample-size was kept consistent to a quarter core of 50  cm  long  (~1  kg)  for  most  samples  and  about  2  to  3  kg  for  conglomerate  samples. Seven  samples were collected in the Bidini deposit from hole BDRCDD009 (Figure 35A), which starts  in  the  Fatoya  Formation  and  ends  in  the  Kintinian  Formation. Five  of  these  samples  were  collected  from  the  conglomerate  interbeds  (samples  BD2,  BD3  and  BD5  to  BD7;  Table  3  in  Electronic Appendices) while the last two samples were of greywacke and shale beds from the  Kintinian  Formation  (samples  BD1  and  BD4;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices;  Figure  36). Eighteen samples were collected along holes KSDD018, KSDD020, KSDD022 and KSDD024 from  the Kosise deposit (samples A to R; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices; Figure 35B). All of these  drill-holes intersect the Fatoya Formation only. Sampling was focused on the greywacke beds,  167 || Sampling was designed to obtain the baseline geochemistry of each sedimentary Formation. In  order to characterise  the geochemical variations associated with early-D3S  mineralised faults,  samples  were  collected  along  a  NW-SE  composite  section,  across  a  discrete  NE-SW  dextral  shear  zone  in  the  Kosise  deposit  and  across  a  NE-SW  shear  zone  and  a  bedding-parallel  N-S  reverse  fault (Figure  35B). The  Kosise  deposit  was  chosen  because  it  is  hosted  in  the  Fatoya  formation,  host  to most  of  the  deposits  (Figure  33),  and  because  its  structural  framework  is  relatively simple and well constrained. Sample spacing was modified according to the shear- zone proximity, grade distribution and apparent alteration. Sampling at intervals of about 10  metres was used in the distal part of the section while shorter intervals of a few metres were  used  around  proximal  alteration  zones. Veins  were  trimmed  off  from  all  samples  to  avoid  nugget  effects. || THE  PROJECTED  POLES  FROM  THE  ENTIRE  KOSISE  DEPOSIT  OF  BEDDING,  V2S  BEDDING-PARALLEL  AND  V2S  EN- ECHELON  VEINS,  HIGHLIGHT  THAT  ORIENTATIONS  AND  SIGMOIDAL  CHARACTER  OF  V2S  VEINS  ARE  CONSISTENT  WITH  THEIR FORMATION BY FLEXURAL SLIP ALONG BEDDING DURING F2S FOLDING.

The en-echelon vein arrays can extend over 2-3 meters, but  individual  veins  typically  extend  for  up  to  50  centimeters. This  oldest  vein  set  is  not  mineralized. The  veins,  the  open  folds in  Kami and  the  F2S  syncline  in  Kosise  are  crosscut by  sub- vertical  discrete  shear  zones,  or  by  what  have  been  defined  as  incipient  structures. For  example,  a  meter-wide  discrete  NE-SW  fault  zone  displaying  dextral  kinematics  is  a  major  structural feature observed in the Kosise deposit (Figure 24C, 24D and 24E) and vein patterns  along minor E-W  trending fault zones  in the  Kami deposit  indicate  normal movements along  these  discrete  structures. However,  incipient  structures  are  more  common  than  discrete  structures in the Kosise and Kami deposits, and are expressed by an abundance of veins along  a 10 to 15 meters-wide damage zone of sheet-like geometry with no visible discrete zone of  faulting  or  shearing  (Figure  24B). || The F2S fold typology varies from south to north  with upright horizontal isoclinal folds and upright vertical open folds in the area of the Sintroko  deposit, to gentle upright to open inclined N-plunging W-verging folds near the Kosise deposit  130 || The matrix correction method was  ZAF utilising the algorithm of Armstrong/Love Scott (Armstrong, 1988). X-Ray  Diffraction  (XRD)  was  used  to  characterise  the  modal  composition  and  its  variations  of  the  geochemical  samples  collected  in  the  Kosise  deposit. Analyses  were  conducted on a Panalytical Empyrean multi-purpose research XRD spectrometer at the CMCA,  UWA. Spectra  were  processed  with  the  HighScore  Plus  software  and  the  final  weighted  R  profile values were all between 5.89 and 11.4 with an average of 8.7. LA-ICP-MS  was  conducted on  all  generations of  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite  found  in  the  district  (V2S,  V3A,  V3B  and  syn-D4S),  as  well  as  on  unconstrained  disseminated  pyrite  hosted  in  the  conglomerate of  the  Bidini  deposit  (Table  4  in  Electronic  Appendices). Samples  of  pyrite  169 || This fold is open, has a vergence to the west (Figure 41A) and has bedding-parallel and  en-echelon V2S veins along both limbs. A number of early-D3S sub-vertical structures crosscut  the F2S syncline, including: NE-SW dextral shear zones, a N-S thrust fault developed along the  steep  limb of  the  fold,  and  an  E-W  normal  fault  (Figure  41C;  Lebrun  et  al.,  in  review  2015a;  Chapter  3). Most  of  the  early-D3S  structures  present  in  this  deposit  are  damage  zones  and  incipient faults, highlighted only by the increase in vein density developed late-D3S in the first  ten-fifteen metres around them (Figure 41B). The two different V3S vein sets (V3A and V3B) were  observed around the damage zones, both in the field and drill core. The V3A vein set develops  in  the  first  few  metres  of  the  damage  zones  whereas  the  V3B  vein  set  commonly  displays  a  dense  lateral  extension  of  up  to  fifteen  metres. In  the  Kosise  deposit,  the  orientation  of  V3A  veins is extremely variable with individual veins showing brecciated textures. || associated with D3S varies from between NW-SE extension to strike-slip deformation related to  NW-SE  extension  and  NE-SW  compression,  which  is  different  to  the  earlier  D2S  E-W  to  ESE- WNW compression. D4S:    The  third  and  last  fold  generation  recorded  in  the  district  (F4S;  Figure  22A)  is  oriented  ENE-WSW  to  NE-SW. At  the  outcrop  to  deposit-scale  the  F4S  folds crenulate  the  F2S  folds and fold the V3S veins (Figure 22A, 26A, 26B, 26C and 26D). A penetrative planar fabric  (S4S)  is  axial  planar  to  these  local  F4S  folds. The  S4S  fabric  is  a  sericite-bearing  cleavage  that  transects  the  F2S  fold  hinges  in  many  areas,  such  as  in  the  Kosise  deposit  (Figure  17),  and  develops  strain  shadows  around  the  arsenopyrite  crystals  in  the  selvage  of  V3B  veins  (Figure  22B and 22C). Overall, D4S is interpreted to have been associated with a NW-SE compression. || been described by a number of authors in recent years (Cook et al., 2013; Large et al., 2011;  Wilkinson  et  al.,  1999). The  present  dataset  do  not  allow  to  conclude  in  regards  to  D4S  gold  occurrence  and  further  work  would  be  required  to  assess  whether  gold  remobilisation  occurred or not. Geochemical footprint of the ore shoots  The  alteration  associated  with  the  superimposition  of  all  four  hydrothermal  events  was  geochemically  characterised  across  the  Siguiri  district  (Figure  42,  43  and  44). In  the  different  deposits  and  in  the  representative  Kosise  deposit  in  particular,  the  geochemical  variations associated with this style of mineralisation are characterised by enrichments in Ag,  Au, As, Bi, S, Sb, Te and W within the first fifteen meters around the ore shoots at minimum  (Figure 44). These enrichments relative to the geochemical baseline of the hosting formation,  are characteristic of hypozonal to mesozonal orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998; Eilu  et al., 1999; Groves et al., 2003) and are accompanied, in Siguiri, by additional increases in Co,  Mo, Na/Al (molar), Se and decreases in Ca, Cs, F, Ga, Hf, 3K/Al (molar), Li, Mg, P and V across  the  main  ore  shoot. These  variations  can  be  directly  related  to  the  hydrothermal  mineral  assemblage associated with the V3A and V3B gold mineralisation event. || prominently  developed  hydrothermal  event,  is  also  the  second  and  principal  gold  mineralisation  event  to  develop  late  during  D3S  deformation. It  is  associated  with  two  distinct  mineralisation  textures. The first texture is best exposed in the Kosise deposit and is characterised by gold bearing  quartz-ankerite-arsenopyrite conjugate V3B veins. Although the bulk of the gold is hosted native in  V3B veins, LA-ICP-MS analyses show that gold can also be found locked into the arsenopyrite crystal  lattice  (up  to  55.5  ppm). The  second  mineralisation  texture  is  best  expressed  in  the  Sanu  Tinti  deposit and consists of disseminated barren pyrite hosted in a polymict conglomerate. The second and third hydrothermal events are both structurally controlled by a series of early- D3S N-S, NE-SW, WNW-ESE and E-W sub-vertical incipient structures expressed as damage zones of  higher  V3S  vein  density. || supported  by  other  studies  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006;  Price  and  Pichler,  2006). Variations  in  As  content also have a direct impact on the unit cell parameters of the pyrite crystal lattice (a, b, c  distances between atoms and α, β, γ angles between a, b and c) which affects the capacity of  this  mineral  to  contain  gold  (Large  et  al.,  2011;  Savage  et  al.,  2000). This  conclusion  is  highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite:  more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure  45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for  the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the  Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit. Comparison with other West African orogenic gold deposits  The  Siguiri  mineralisation  footprint  has  many  similarities  with  other  West  African  orogenic gold deposits. In particular, mineralisation at the Massawa deposit in Eastern Senegal  (Treloar et al., 2014) is structurally controlled and hosted along sub-vertical NE-trending shear  zones similar to the Kosise deposit.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Košiše, Tunjice, Kamnik, Upravna Enota Kamnik, 1241, Slovenia<br><b>Pages:</b> 100,108,115,116,117,119,143,152,153,154,16,168,172,176,177,181,182,183,35,98<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

This  first  magmatic  event  was  interpreted  as  associated  with  the  syn-D3Lo  gold-tourmaline event in Loulo (KKI) and with the syn-D2M intrusion related gold mineralisation  in  Morila  and  early  gold  mineralisation  at  Obuasi  (Fougerouse  et  al.,  2015;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a; Lawrence et al., 2013b; McFarlane et al., 2011). 201 || Obuasi, Sadiola  and  Loulo;  Fougerouse  et al.,  in  press; Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  2015;  Lawrence  et al.,  2013a;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013b),  atypical  orogenic  gold  (e.g. Masawa  deposit;  Treloar  et  al.,  2015),  29 || Prior to the switch, fluids are stored under  high  pressure  in  the  rock  mass  and  fluid  mobility  and  veining  are  minor. When  the  switch  occurs, a stress threshold is overcome allowing the barrier to be breached and fluids to flow  into an organized vein network. Geodynamic interpretation and drivers of stress-switches  Drivers of the different stress-switches observed in the Siguiri district may have a local  cause, including: 1) continuous local overburden build up; 2) fault irregularities; 3) earthquake  focal  behaviour  dynamics,  or  4)  a  regional  scale mechanism,  such  as  plate  convergence  rate  drop (Upton and Craw, 2013; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Beroza and Zoback, 1993). However, stress- switches  have  been  documented  in  many  other  orogenic  gold  systems  around  the  world,  including Archean examples (Bouiller and Robert, 1992;  Holyland and Ojala, 1997; Nguyen et  al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; e.g. in the Yilgarn: the Waroonga  and  New-Holland-Genesis  deposits,  Thébaud  et  al.,  2013). In  the  Birimian  of  West  Africa,  stress-switches have been recognised as one of the crucial triggers for mineralization in several  gold  deposits  (Ashanti  in  Ghana,  Sadiola,  Loulo  and  possibly  Morila  in  Mali,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a;  Masurel  et  al.,  this  volume;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011). || The  overprinting  gold  mineralisation  event  recognized  Craton-wide  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma  is  not  represented in the Siguiri district but represents the main source of gold in other deposits of  the  West  African  Craton  (e.g. Morila,  Loulo,  Sadiola). This  study  support  the  idea  that  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri and in West Africa is polyphase and that careful consideration of the  Siguiri district mineralisation timings could lead to future gold discovery in the Siguiri Basin. 204<br><b>Geocode:</b> Loulo, Kivetia, Bashu, Beni, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo<br><b>Pages:</b> 129,184,187,29<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  upper  Birimian  sediments  were  derived  from  Paleoproterozoic  volcanic  rocks  and  felsic  intrusions  that were emplaced during the early stages of the Eburnean orogeny (Milési et al. 1989; Begg  et al. 2009; Feybesse and Milési 1994).

It comes from the Marble Hill  location, a hill made of marbles, conglomerate and greywacke sedimentary rocks. The modal  composition of this sample is similar to the previous greywacke, with about 20 vol% quartz, 25  vol%  albite  and 20 vol%  white  micas. The proportion of clasts  is however higher than in the  other greywacke samples. Zircons are medium to dark brown, display an average crystal size of  50x70  μm,  are  reasonably  fractured  and  mostly  subhedral  to  anhedral.

However, in the conglomerate units in and  around the Marble Hill, limestone clasts increase in proportion (drill-hole SIDD002; Figure 5A). The Marble Hill conglomerates are viewed as a locally sourced lateral variation of the Kintinian  conglomerate  found  in  the  Sanu  Tinti  deposit. The  meta-limestone  beds  are  therefore  considered to represent the overturned stratigraphic top of the Fatoya Formation or base of  the Kintinian Formation (Figure 9).

However, available data show that the Kintinian conglomerates occur as thick  (~10-15 m) deposits overlain by thin (<50 cm) shale to mudstone intervals. The conglomerates  were observed at  the contact  with Fatoya greywackes, above  a thrust  fault in the  Sanu Tinti  deposit, and reworking meta-limestone/marble in drill cores from the Silakoro area. Based on  the  current  data,  the  conglomeratic  layers  sit  near  the  base  of  the  Kintinian  Formation,  are  overlain  by  mudstone  and  boudinaged  limestone  interbeds  representing  the  bulk  of  the  Kintinian Formation (Figure 6F), and their true thickness varies across the map and in cores. In  order  to  integrate  the  observations  from  the  Siguiri  district  in  the  broader  Siguiri  basin  framework,  two  additional  localities  were  investigated: the  Marble  Hill  and  the  Saraya  area  (Figure  3B  and  5A). Located  between  the  Kintinian  and  the  Fatoya  Formations  in  map  view  (area  around  sample  Si241  on  Figure  5A),  the  Marble  Hill  displays  conglomerate  and  greywacke sitting on top of strongly foliated meta-limestone beds (Figure 6D). || Formation  is  estimated  at  ~400m  (Figure  9).

This  first  magmatic  event  was  interpreted  as  associated  with  the  syn-D3Lo  gold-tourmaline event in Loulo (KKI) and with the syn-D2M intrusion related gold mineralisation  in  Morila  and  early  gold  mineralisation  at  Obuasi  (Fougerouse  et  al.,  2015;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a; Lawrence et al., 2013b; McFarlane et al., 2011). 201 || ABSTRACT  The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as  Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri. However,  the  Craton  is  still  largely  unexplored  and  its  formation,  evolution  and  how  and  when  the  gold  deposits  it  hosts  developed  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  remain  unclear. The  Siguiri  district  is  one  of  West  Africa's  largest  Paleoproterozoic  sedimentary  basins  and  sits  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. The  district and its hosting Basin have received limited attention from the scientific community to  date. This  thesis  makes  use  of  a  multi-scale  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  in  order  to  constrain the evolution of the  Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin architecture and hydrothermal  activity through time. The objective is to provide the backbone of future exploration strategies  for orogenic gold deposits in the Siguiri Basin and, potentially, in the rest of the West African  Craton. || The  overprinting  gold  mineralisation  event  recognized  Craton-wide  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma  is  not  represented in the Siguiri district but represents the main source of gold in other deposits of  the  West  African  Craton  (e.g. Morila,  Loulo,  Sadiola). This  study  support  the  idea  that  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri and in West Africa is polyphase and that careful consideration of the  Siguiri district mineralisation timings could lead to future gold discovery in the Siguiri Basin. 204 || Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  the  gold events  in  Siguiri  (syn-D3S  and  syn-D4S)  occurred  during  the  ca. 2102-2085  Ma  episode  of  gold  mineralisation  recognized across the West African Craton. These conclusions have a direct impact on orogenic  gold  exploration  since  these  suggest  that  younger  economic  gold  mineralisation  coeval  with  the  second  episode  of  magmatism  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma,  such  as  the  late  gold  overprint  in  Morila, could be found in the Siguiri Basin. Conclusion  The Siguiri district, hosted in the weakly metamorphosed sediments of the Siguiri Basin  (Guinea)  is  characterized  by  a  polyphase  hydrothermal  history  and  two  textures  of  the  hydrothermal mineral assemblages. The dominant texture, or Kosise style, displays vein haloes  structurally  controlled  by  early-D3S  N-S,  NE-SW,  WNW-ESE  and  E-W  damage  zones. || M., Mavrogenes, J., Lentz, D., King, K., Allibone, A., and Holcombe, R., 2011,  Geology  and  Intrusion-Related  Affinity  of  the  Morila  Gold  Mine,  Southeast  Mali:  Economic Geology, v. 106, p. 727-750.

Mineral  and  geochemical  footprint  and  timing  of  the  gold  events  in  the  Siguiri  district,  when  compared  with  other  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton,  highlight  the  synchronicity  of  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri (syn-D3S and syn-D4S events) with other events of gold mineralisation in this  part  of  the  Craton,  such  as  the  early  Au-Sb-Bi-(Te-W)  mineralisation  at  the  Morila  deposit  in  Southeast Mali. Results support the idea that late Eburnean-age gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district and in the West African Craton as a whole, is polyphase and that economic post-D4S gold  mineralisation could be found in the Siguiri Basin.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Morila, Dioïla Cercle, Koulikoro, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 143,184<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

This  younger  episode  of  magmatism,  dated  between  ca. 2085-2054  Ma,  is  coeval  with  the  second  episode  of  gold  mineralisation,  recognized in the deposits of Loulo in the KKI, Morila in Mali, as well as Damang and Obuasi in  Ghana (Fougerouse et al., 2015; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; McFarlane et al., 2011). In  comparison,  the  Siguiri  district  syn-D3S  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  (V3A  and  V3B  veining)  was  overprinted  by  a  latter  phase  of  gold  mineralisation  or  remobilisation,  syn-D4S. The D4S deformation was responsible for the development of the NNE-SSW S4S cleavage, sub- parallel  to  the  sub-solidus  fabric  observed  in  the  Malea  monzogranite,  outcropping  to  the  north of the district (Figure 32) and emplaced along with the Saraya volcanic breccia during the  first  episode  of  magmatism  discussed  above  (Figure  47). Based  on  the orientation  of  the  S4S  cleavage and sub-solidus fabric in the Malea monzogranite, we interpret the emplacement of  this  intrusive  and  of  the  Saraya  volcanic  breccia  as  coeval  with  the  formation  of  the  S4S  cleavage  recognized  in  the  Siguiri  district. || Prior to the switch, fluids are stored under  high  pressure  in  the  rock  mass  and  fluid  mobility  and  veining  are  minor. When  the  switch  occurs, a stress threshold is overcome allowing the barrier to be breached and fluids to flow  into an organized vein network. Geodynamic interpretation and drivers of stress-switches  Drivers of the different stress-switches observed in the Siguiri district may have a local  cause, including: 1) continuous local overburden build up; 2) fault irregularities; 3) earthquake  focal  behaviour  dynamics,  or  4)  a  regional  scale mechanism,  such  as  plate  convergence  rate  drop (Upton and Craw, 2013; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Beroza and Zoback, 1993). However, stress- switches  have  been  documented  in  many  other  orogenic  gold  systems  around  the  world,  including Archean examples (Bouiller and Robert, 1992;  Holyland and Ojala, 1997; Nguyen et  al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; e.g. in the Yilgarn: the Waroonga  and  New-Holland-Genesis  deposits,  Thébaud  et  al.,  2013). In  the  Birimian  of  West  Africa,  stress-switches have been recognised as one of the crucial triggers for mineralization in several  gold  deposits  (Ashanti  in  Ghana,  Sadiola,  Loulo  and  possibly  Morila  in  Mali,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a;  Masurel  et  al.,  this  volume;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 129,186<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

(1989); Milési et al., (1992). The  location  of  orogenic  gold  deposits  is  typically  controlled  by  complex  regional-scale  fault  networks (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2000). In West Africa, the Ashanti fault system in  Ghana, is one example of such a network, and its many faults host some of the biggest vein- hosted  and  fault-vein-hosted  orogenic  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Obuasi,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002;  Fougerouse  et  al.,  this  volume). The  Siguiri  district  (240  t/7.9  Moz;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  2013;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  n.d.)  is  unusual  in  West  Africa  because  it  is  not  located  on  a  recognized  large  regional  scale  fault  system. || Obuasi, Sadiola  and  Loulo;  Fougerouse  et al.,  in  press; Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  2015;  Lawrence  et al.,  2013a;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013b),  atypical  orogenic  gold  (e.g. Masawa  deposit;  Treloar  et  al.,  2015),  29 || ABSTRACT  The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as  Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri.

When  the  switch  occurs, a stress threshold is overcome allowing the barrier to be breached and fluids to flow  into an organized vein network. Geodynamic interpretation and drivers of stress-switches  Drivers of the different stress-switches observed in the Siguiri district may have a local  cause, including: 1) continuous local overburden build up; 2) fault irregularities; 3) earthquake  focal  behaviour  dynamics,  or  4)  a  regional  scale mechanism,  such  as  plate  convergence  rate  drop (Upton and Craw, 2013; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Beroza and Zoback, 1993). However, stress- switches  have  been  documented  in  many  other  orogenic  gold  systems  around  the  world,  including Archean examples (Bouiller and Robert, 1992;  Holyland and Ojala, 1997; Nguyen et  al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; e.g. in the Yilgarn: the Waroonga  and  New-Holland-Genesis  deposits,  Thébaud  et  al.,  2013). In  the  Birimian  of  West  Africa,  stress-switches have been recognised as one of the crucial triggers for mineralization in several  gold  deposits  (Ashanti  in  Ghana,  Sadiola,  Loulo  and  possibly  Morila  in  Mali,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a;  Masurel  et  al.,  this  volume;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011). || The  overprinting  gold  mineralisation  event  recognized  Craton-wide  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma  is  not  represented in the Siguiri district but represents the main source of gold in other deposits of  the  West  African  Craton  (e.g. Morila,  Loulo,  Sadiola).

In AEM, the Saraya area shows a low response similar to that  of the Fatoya Formation. The Saraya metasediments are however overlain unconformably by  67 || sedimentation. However, available data show that the Kintinian conglomerates occur as thick  (~10-15 m) deposits overlain by thin (<50 cm) shale to mudstone intervals. The conglomerates  were observed at  the contact  with Fatoya greywackes, above  a thrust  fault in the  Sanu Tinti  deposit, and reworking meta-limestone/marble in drill cores from the Silakoro area.

(1991) and Upton and Craw (2013), arise  from a transient alteration of an ongoing geodynamic process, such as the modification of the  collision  rate,  an  overall  change  in  plate  motion  (Fig. 9  from  Goldfarb  et  al.,  2005),  or  the  sudden rise of magma from a hot spot (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Idnurm, 2000), while variations in  body forces are commonly linked to readjustments of topographic highs or delamination (Rey  and Houseman, 2006). Based on the regional extent of the stress-switches identified in Siguiri and throughout  the rest of the West African Craton, we propose that the dominant stress drivers affecting the  district evolved from a far field stress dominated to a body forces dominated environment. In a  far  field  stress  dominated  environment,  such  as  during  an  accretion,  the  local  stress-field  is  controlled  by  the  regional  stress-field  orientation,  such  as  the  plate  boundary  motions. In  a  body  forces  dominated  environment,  such  as  during  late  delamination  or  readjustment  of  topographic  highs,  the  local  stress-field  is  controlled  by  the  local  variations  in  stress-field  orientation,  such  as  the  location  of  delaminated  lithosphere  or  of  topographic  highs. || 5, p. 49-73.

Geochemical variations associated with  the ore shoots in the Siguiri district are consistent with petrographic observations and highlight an  albite-carbonate-sulphide-sericite alteration system. The  fourth  and  last  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  a  late  penetrative  S4S  cleavage  during  D4S  deformation. This  late  deformation  event  overprints  all  pre- existing hydrothermal events and is associated with the deposition of free gold, chalcopyrite and  galena along fractures in V3A pyrite and V3B pyrite and arsenopyrite. Mineral  and  geochemical  footprint  and  timing  of  the  gold  events  in  the  Siguiri  district,  when  compared  with  other  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton,  highlight  the  synchronicity  of  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri (syn-D3S and syn-D4S events) with other events of gold mineralisation in this  part  of  the  Craton,  such  as  the  early  Au-Sb-Bi-(Te-W)  mineralisation  at  the  Morila  deposit  in  Southeast Mali. Results support the idea that late Eburnean-age gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district and in the West African Craton as a whole, is polyphase and that economic post-D4S gold  mineralisation could be found in the Siguiri Basin. || ABSTRACT  The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as  Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri. However,  the  Craton  is  still  largely  unexplored  and  its  formation,  evolution  and  how  and  when  the  gold  deposits  it  hosts  developed  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  remain  unclear. The  Siguiri  district  is  one  of  West  Africa's  largest  Paleoproterozoic  sedimentary  basins  and  sits  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. The  district and its hosting Basin have received limited attention from the scientific community to  date. This  thesis  makes  use  of  a  multi-scale  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  in  order  to  constrain the evolution of the  Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin architecture and hydrothermal  activity through time. The objective is to provide the backbone of future exploration strategies  for orogenic gold deposits in the Siguiri Basin and, potentially, in the rest of the West African  Craton. || Albite can sometimes be found in these veins but this set is usually cross-cutting  the already albitised host-rock. The V3B veins are filled with quartz-ankerite with arsenopyrite,  pyrite and minor millimetric siderite nodules along the selvages (Figure 28K). These veins can  infrequently be found associated with minor albite, but are overall cross-cutting the albitised  host-rock. Native gold occurs in the quartz (Figure 20E) or at the contact between quartz and  ankerite. Currently, most gold produced at Siguiri is associated with the V3B vein set. There is a first-order structural control on both the disseminated and vein hosted gold  mineralization in the Siguiri district, in that both occur within the first ten to twenty meters of  the  four  groups  of  faults  mapped  in  this  study  (Figure  28C,  28D  and  28F). || Conclusion  The clastic sediment-hosted orogenic gold deposits of Siguiri, in northeast Guinea, are  primarily  hosted  in  the  greywacke  of  the  Fatoya  Formation  and  to  lesser  extents  in  the  turbidites  of  adjacent  Balato  and  Kintinian  Formations. The  district  has  been  the  site  of  a  protracted and polyphase deformation divided into four local deformation stages (D1S to D4S),  all of which are attributed to Eburnean orogenesis. D1S was a cryptic N-S compressional event. The  main  deformation  event  D2S,  was  an  E-W  to  ENE-WSW  directed  compressional  event  responsible  for  the  bulk  of  the  deformation  affecting  the  Siguiri  Basin  metasediments. D3S  represents  a  progressive  evolution  of  D2S  compression  into  an  E-W  transpressional  event,  evolving into a transient period of NNW-SSE transtension. This latter episode of deformation is  associated with the bulk of veining observed in the Siguiri district and is also the main stage of  mineralization. || Discussion  Structural event history  The  field  relationships  documented  in  the  Siguiri  district  suggest  a  polyphase  deformation history. All structural elements documented in the Siguiri district can be grouped  in 4 sequential deformation events that have been termed D1S, D2S, D3S, and D4S. Within these  events, 3 distinct folding events and 3 distinct veining events can be determined (Figure  25),  allowing  the  relative  timing  and  geometric  controls  on  mineralization  to  be  placed  into  the  overall structural evolution of the district. Figure 25: Summary table of the deformation events and timing of the structural features recognized at Siguiri in this  study with the work from Milési et al. (1989, 1992), Miller et al. (2013) and Steyn (2012). || Even  though  all  these  studies  propose  that  gold  mineralisation  in  Siguiri  is  dominantly  controlled by veins, no consensus was reached by the authors on what controls the location of  the Siguiri gold district at the scale of the Siguiri Basin or what controls the extent of the ore  shoots at the district and deposit scales. To  further  the  understanding  of  the  characteristics,  geometry  and  genesis  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district,  a  multi-scale  and  multidisciplinary  approach  was  employed. This  approach  addresses  the  various  scales  at  which  geological  processes  work  in  gold  mineral  systems. Modern  gold  exploration  strategies  increasingly  rely  on  such  an  approach,  involving  integration  of  fieldwork,  geophysics,  and  geochemistry  among  other  techniques, used at different scales (McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; McCuaig et al., 2010; Robert  et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2010; Williams and Currie, 1993; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Blewett  et  al.,  2010;  Goldfarb  et  al.,  2005;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Groves  et  al.,  2000;  Neumayr  et  al.,  2008; Eilu and Groves, 2001; Eilu et al., 1999). At a province scale, numerous studies highlight  the role of early architecture as a primary control on gold mineralisation (Robert et al., 2005;  Miller et al., 2010; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Chapter two). Down one  scale at the  district  level,  secondary  structures  control  and/or  host  gold  mineralisation  (Blewett  et  al.,  2010;  32 || Figure  42:  Geochemical  spider-diagrams  of  the  A)  least  altered  samples  collected  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  normalised to least altered Fatoya greywacke sample (sample O, collected in the Kosise deposit), representative of  the  lithologies  hosting  the  bulk  of  the  mineralisation  in  Siguiri.

A) EN-ECHELON BARREN QUARTZ V2S  VEINS. || Results of paleostress analysis on conjugate vein sets on mineralized vein sets that formed late  during  D3S  indicate  that  the  stress-field  ranged  from  extensional  to  strike-slip,  sometimes  within  the  same  vein  locality. The  late-D3S  deformation  is  interpreted  to  have  been  a  transtensional event. The first change in the principal stress axes orientation is interpreted to  be related to a continuous switch from a far field-dominated to a body force-dominated stress  field  reducing  the  deviatoric  component  on  the  stress  tensor. The  second  change  in  the  principal stress axes orientation from early-D3S transpression to late-D3S transtension, suggests  that 1 and 2 were close in magnitude, which is inferred to have facilitated localized stress- switches. In  the  Siguiri  district,  the  early-D3S  and  late-D3S  stress-switches  which  occurred  at  both a local and regional scale, have enhanced fracture permeability and are seen as a critical  element  for  the establishment  of  active  fluid  pathways  leading  to  the  formation  of  a  world- class gold system. Keywords: West Africa; Siguiri; orogenic gold; tectonics; stress-switch  103 || The  last  deformation  event,  D4S,  was  a  NE-SW  compressional  event  which  created  a  penetrative  cleavage  in  the  entire  rock  mass  and  is  post  the  main  stage  of  mineralization at Siguiri. The orogenic gold mineralization in the Siguiri district is associated with two principal  vein types: 1) early gold-rich pyrite and ankerite brecciated veins proximal to NW-SE structures  and  2)  crosscutting  quartz-carbonate-arsenopyrite  conjugate  veins. The  second,  and  most  common  vein  type,  is  preferentially  developed  along  four  orientations  of  discrete  faults  or  incipient  structures:  N-S  to  NNE-SSW  thrusts,  NE-SW  to  ENE-WSW  dextral  shear  zones,  E-W  normal  faults  and  WNW-ESE  sinistral  shear  zones. These  structures  may  represent  the  local  expression of more fundamental and deeper structures that control the location of the Siguiri  district within the Siguiri Basin. Based on finite strain and conjugate vein analysis, the veining and gold mineralization  are interpreted to have culminated late during the D3S progressive deformation event, as the  local stress-field was switching in response to the waning of the regional maximum stress. The  stress-switches  documented  in  this  study  have  been  widely  recognized  to  happen  at  2070- 2080 Ma across the whole West African Craton and are not restricted to the study area. || These  veins  commonly  display  crack-seal  textures  typical  of  gold  bearing  veins  in  orogenic-type  deposits  and  consistent  with  fault-valve  pulsative  behaviour  (Sibson et al., 1988; Sibson et al., 1998). The steep orientation is the most prominent vein set  developed in Siguiri and was also observed and mined by artisanal miners within and outside  of  the  Siguiri  district. Higher  densities  of  these  veins  develop  around  all  four  orientations  of  discrete  and  incipient  faults  described  in  the  previous  sections  and  represent  the  main  ore  shoots in the district (Figure 24A, 24B and 28C and 28F). Conjugate analyses on the V3B veins,  together  with  the  fault  pattern  geometry  mapped  in  the  pits,  indicates  that  the  stress-field  133 || Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  the  gold events  in  Siguiri  (syn-D3S  and  syn-D4S)  occurred  during  the  ca. 2102-2085  Ma  episode  of  gold  mineralisation  recognized across the West African Craton. These conclusions have a direct impact on orogenic  gold  exploration  since  these  suggest  that  younger  economic  gold  mineralisation  coeval  with  the  second  episode  of  magmatism  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma,  such  as  the  late  gold  overprint  in  Morila, could be found in the Siguiri Basin. Conclusion  The Siguiri district, hosted in the weakly metamorphosed sediments of the Siguiri Basin  (Guinea)  is  characterized  by  a  polyphase  hydrothermal  history  and  two  textures  of  the  hydrothermal mineral assemblages. The dominant texture, or Kosise style, displays vein haloes  structurally  controlled  by  early-D3S  N-S,  NE-SW,  WNW-ESE  and  E-W  damage  zones. || absolute timing constraint that could later be used to relate the overall deformation history in  Siguiri  to  that  of  the  overall  West  African  Craton  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny.

This  site  was  also  selected  for  dating,  lithostratigraphic  and  structural observations. In addition to these two regional localities,  a transect from Siguiri to  the  Archean  Kénéma-Man  Craton  was  completed. This  transect  focused  on  the  lithostratigraphic and structural characterisation of the Siguiri Basin sediments, extrusives and  intrusives  rocks  as  well  as  the  igneous  and  gneissic  rocks  located  along  and  beyond  the  Sassandra fault.

Since petrographic observations indicate that the Sanu Tinti disseminated pyrite is  overprinted by the S4S cleavage, we propose that both V3B and Sanu Tinti disseminated pyrite  formed coevally late during D3S. Both mineralisation textures developed along the early-D3S N-S  thrust  at  the  contact  between  the  Kintinian  and  the  Fatoya  Formation. The  change  in  mineralisation texture from the Fatoya to the Kintinian Formation is common in orogenic gold  deposits (Dubé and Gosselin, 2007; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Groves, 1993) and interpreted  to  be  linked  to  the  higher  porosity  and  lower  competency  of  the  Kintinian  conglomerate  compared  to  the  sediments  of  the  Fatoya  Formation. The  second  and  main  episode  of  gold  mineralisation  identified  in  Siguiri  was  found  to  be  associated  with  both  mineralisation  textures.

The  present  dataset  do  not  allow  to  conclude  in  regards  to  D4S  gold  occurrence  and  further  work  would  be  required  to  assess  whether  gold  remobilisation  occurred or not. Geochemical footprint of the ore shoots  The  alteration  associated  with  the  superimposition  of  all  four  hydrothermal  events  was  geochemically  characterised  across  the  Siguiri  district  (Figure  42,  43  and  44). In  the  different  deposits  and  in  the  representative  Kosise  deposit  in  particular,  the  geochemical  variations associated with this style of mineralisation are characterised by enrichments in Ag,  Au, As, Bi, S, Sb, Te and W within the first fifteen meters around the ore shoots at minimum  (Figure 44). These enrichments relative to the geochemical baseline of the hosting formation,  are characteristic of hypozonal to mesozonal orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998; Eilu  et al., 1999; Groves et al., 2003) and are accompanied, in Siguiri, by additional increases in Co,  Mo, Na/Al (molar), Se and decreases in Ca, Cs, F, Ga, Hf, 3K/Al (molar), Li, Mg, P and V across  the  main  ore  shoot. These  variations  can  be  directly  related  to  the  hydrothermal  mineral  assemblage associated with the V3A and V3B gold mineralisation event. || geochronology  of  the  central  Siguiri  Basin  rocks.

This paper presents the structural evolution of the Siguiri  district  and  the  second  and  third  order  structures  hosting  the  mineralisation. It  also  discusses  the  mode  of  emplacement  and  stress-field  variations  associated  with the veins hosting the bulk of the mineralisation in Siguiri;  4)  one paper submitted to Mineralium Deposita (Chapter four). This paper presents  the  petrographic  and  geochemical  characteristics  of  the  mineral  assemblages  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district. || supported  by  other  studies  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006;  Price  and  Pichler,  2006). Variations  in  As  content also have a direct impact on the unit cell parameters of the pyrite crystal lattice (a, b, c  distances between atoms and α, β, γ angles between a, b and c) which affects the capacity of  this  mineral  to  contain  gold  (Large  et  al.,  2011;  Savage  et  al.,  2000). This  conclusion  is  highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite:  more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure  45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for  the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the  Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit. Comparison with other West African orogenic gold deposits  The  Siguiri  mineralisation  footprint  has  many  similarities  with  other  West  African  orogenic gold deposits. In particular, mineralisation at the Massawa deposit in Eastern Senegal  (Treloar et al., 2014) is structurally controlled and hosted along sub-vertical NE-trending shear  zones similar to the Kosise deposit. || Comparison of the characteristics and timing of gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  with  other  gold  deposits  from  the  West  African  Craton  indicates that gold mineralisation in Siguiri is coeval with mineralisation in other gold deposits. However,  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  in  the  West  African  Craton  are  associated  with  later  gold events that may have formed economic concentrations in the rest of the Siguiri Basin. The  conclusions  from  this  multi-scale  multi-disciplinary  work  have  implications  for  exploration targeting in and around the Siguiri Basin. This thesis highlights the importance of  the early architecture as a first order control on orogenic gold systems. The expression of the  second  and  third  order  structures  controlling  the  mineralisation  are  thought  to  develop  in  response  to  regional stress-switches  that  can  be  recognised  in  the  field. Finally,  at  a  deposit  scale, high grade zones can be targeted by geochemistry.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Siguiri, Siguiri Prefecture, Kankan Region, Guinea<br><b>Pages:</b> 100,113,118,122,130,131,132,143,16,172,181,182,183,186,32,36,38,5,87,94,7<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Gold  mineralization  is  either  disseminated in style or vein-hosted.

A switch to a phase of brittle deformation marks the end stage of the D2S event in the  Siguiri district and is associated with the development of V2S veining and D2S brittle faults.

These basins are less common compared to  the other two. When  put  into  the  regional  context  of  the  West  African  Craton,  the  maximum  sedimentation  ages  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district  appear  younger  than  the  Lower  Birimian  rocks (Figure 15). For example, the Sefwi Formation in Ghana (Perrouti et al., 2012), which is  dominated  by  pyroclastics  and  volcanoclastics,  has  an  age  of  crystallisation/deposition  of  2162±6 Ma (Loh et al., 1999) and is associated with important basaltic and andesitic volcanism  dated from around ca. || 2015  Ma,  making  the  Siguiri  Basin relatively young compared to most West African sedimentary basins.

Fieldwork and sampling  In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  identified  in  the  previous  section,  fieldwork  was  conducted in and around the Siguiri district. A total of 22 weeks were spent in the field over  the  course  of  this  study. Fieldwork  was  focused  on  geological  and  structural  mapping,  core  logging and sampling in the  different  deposits of the district  but  was  also conducted around  the district and outside of the Siguiri Basin. Thirteen deposits from the Siguiri district were accessible over the course of this study. From  south  to  north:  Sintroko  PB1,  Sintroko  PB2C,  Sintroko  PB3A,  Sintroko  North,  Kosise,  Kami, Kozan, Kalamagna PB1, Tubani, Bidini, Sanu Tinti, Eureka North and Seguelen (Figure 2). || A  composite  geochemical  cross-section  across  damage  zones  from  the  Kosise  deposit,  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  is  associated  with  enrichments in Ag, Au, As, Bi, Co, Mo, Sb, Se, S, Te and W. Geochemical variations associated with  the ore shoots in the Siguiri district are consistent with petrographic observations and highlight an  albite-carbonate-sulphide-sericite alteration system. The  fourth  and  last  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  a  late  penetrative  S4S  cleavage  during  D4S  deformation. This  late  deformation  event  overprints  all  pre- existing hydrothermal events and is associated with the deposition of free gold, chalcopyrite and  galena along fractures in V3A pyrite and V3B pyrite and arsenopyrite. Mineral  and  geochemical  footprint  and  timing  of  the  gold  events  in  the  Siguiri  district,  when  compared  with  other  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton,  highlight  the  synchronicity  of  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri (syn-D3S and syn-D4S events) with other events of gold mineralisation in this  part  of  the  Craton,  such  as  the  early  Au-Sb-Bi-(Te-W)  mineralisation  at  the  Morila  deposit  in  Southeast Mali. Results support the idea that late Eburnean-age gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district and in the West African Craton as a whole, is polyphase and that economic post-D4S gold  mineralisation could be found in the Siguiri Basin. || ABSTRACT  The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as  Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri. However,  the  Craton  is  still  largely  unexplored  and  its  formation,  evolution  and  how  and  when  the  gold  deposits  it  hosts  developed  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  remain  unclear. The  Siguiri  district  is  one  of  West  Africa's  largest  Paleoproterozoic  sedimentary  basins  and  sits  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. The  district and its hosting Basin have received limited attention from the scientific community to  date. This  thesis  makes  use  of  a  multi-scale  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  in  order  to  constrain the evolution of the  Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin architecture and hydrothermal  activity through time. The objective is to provide the backbone of future exploration strategies  for orogenic gold deposits in the Siguiri Basin and, potentially, in the rest of the West African  Craton. || Albite can sometimes be found in these veins but this set is usually cross-cutting  the already albitised host-rock. The V3B veins are filled with quartz-ankerite with arsenopyrite,  pyrite and minor millimetric siderite nodules along the selvages (Figure 28K). These veins can  infrequently be found associated with minor albite, but are overall cross-cutting the albitised  host-rock. Native gold occurs in the quartz (Figure 20E) or at the contact between quartz and  ankerite. Currently, most gold produced at Siguiri is associated with the V3B vein set. There is a first-order structural control on both the disseminated and vein hosted gold  mineralization in the Siguiri district, in that both occur within the first ten to twenty meters of  the  four  groups  of  faults  mapped  in  this  study  (Figure  28C,  28D  and  28F). || All  these  elements  define  the knowledge base to improve exploration strategies in and around the Siguiri Basin as well as  in the broader West African Craton. AIMS OF THESIS  Based  on  background  information  and  knowledge  gaps  identified  in  the  Siguiri  Basin  and Siguiri district, the principal objectives of this study are to:  1)  Characterise  the  lithostratigraphy  and  tectonic  significance  of  the  Siguiri  district  and  Siguiri Basin sediments in the context of the Eburnean orogeny;   2)  Use  this  newly  developed  understanding  to  highlight  the  early  architecture  of  the  Siguiri Basin and the large scale structures which may have played a fundamental role  in the location of the Siguiri district;   3)  Characterise  the  structural  evolution of  the  district,  attributing  relative  timing to the  major  structures  and  deformation  events  in  the  context  of  previous  structural  work  conducted in West Africa;  4)  Develop  an  integrated  model  for  the  control  on  the  geometry  and  mineralisation  processes within the Siguiri district at the ore shoot, ore body and district scales;  33 || As  initially  suggested  by  Steyn  (2011),  competency  contrasts  also  play  an  important  role in the focusing of mineralizing fluids and on the location of the ore shoots through strain  partitioning. At  the  scale  of  the  Siguiri  district  the  more  competent  Fatoya  Formation  hosts  most  of  the  deposits  and  this  reflects  the  fact  this  unit  has  a  rheology  that  preferentially  fractures rather than forming a penetrative cleavage. At a deposit scale, veining develops more  intensely in competent greywacke beds (Figure 19E, 23A, 24A, 24B, 28E and 28F). Competency  contrast  is  also  thought  to  have  played  an  important  role  in  the  Sanu  Tinti  deposit  where  mineralized sulfides are found disseminated in the porous conglomerate layers of the Kintinian  Formation  rather  than  in  the  less  permeable  greywacke  and  shale  beds  of  the  Fatoya  Formation (Figure 28F to 28H). Compared to the general characteristics described by Dube and  Gosselin (2007), the styles, controls, and late timing of mineralization (syn-D3S) with respect to  the main compressional event (D2S), is consistent with an orogenic gold style of mineralization  in the Siguiri district. 138 || Both these gold episodes are overprinted by a late penetrative NNE-SSW S4S cleavage  associated  with  free  gold-chalcopyrite-galena  infilling  V3A  pyrite  and  V3B  pyrite  and  arsenopyrite fractures. Geochemistry  conducted  in  different  deposits  and  a  composite  geochemical  cross- section  across  ore  shoots  reveals  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  is  associated  with host rock enrichments in: Ag, Au, As, Bi, Sb, Te and W, typical of mesozonal to hypozonal  orogenic gold deposits. These enrichments are also accompanied by additional increases in Co,  Mo, Na/Al (molar), Se and S and decreases in Ca, Cs, F, Ga, Hf, 3K/Al (molar), Li, Mg, P and V  across the main ore shoot. These chemical changes can be linked to the paragenetic sequence,  are indicative of an albite-carbonate-sulphide-sericite alteration associated with the ore shoots  and may increase the size of the targets for exploration. Comparison of the syn-D3S and syn-D4S gold mineralisation timing at the Siguiri district  with  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  from  West  Africa  indicates  that  these  gold  mineralisation  events  are  coeval  with  other  gold  events  recognized  Craton-wide  at  ca. 2102-2085  Ma. || CHAPTER 2: PAPER ONE  GEOCHRONOLOGY AND LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY OF THE  SIGUIRI DISTRICT: IMPLICATIONS FOR GOLD  MINERALISATION IN THE SIGUIRI BASIN (GUINEA, WEST  AFRICA)  The Siguiri district sits alone in the central Siguiri Basin, one of the biggest sedimentary  basins  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  following  paper  presents  the  lithostratigraphy  and  geochronology of the central part of the Siguiri Basin. The study is based on field observations  and  geophysical  datasets  from  the  whole  Siguiri  Basin. This  work  constitutes  the  first  integrated study of the Siguiri Basin lithostratigraphy and geochronology. A total of six new U- Pb  ages  were  determined  from  three  sedimentary  Formations  (four  ages)  and  two  igneous  rocks. The  Siguiri  Basin  sediments  were  deposited  around  ca. || CHAPTER 3: PAPER TWO  STRUCTURAL CONTROLS ON THE WORLD-CLASS SIGUIRI  GOLD DISTRICT, SIGUIRI BASIN, GUINEA, WEST AFRICA  The following paper presents the structural framework associated with the Siguiri gold  district  and  its  evolution  through  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  study  is  based  on  field  observations, geophysical datasets, drill core logging and petrographic observations. This work  focuses  on  district  and  deposit-scale  observations  of  the  second  and  third  order  structures  controlling  gold  mineralisation. It  describes  the  different  structural  features  encountered  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  the  link  they  have  with  gold  mineralisation. This  paper  discusses  the  deformation  history  of  the  Siguiri  district,  the  development  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  district and the stress-field variations associated with this mineralisation. Based on this work,  four  deformation  events  were  recognized  to  affect  the  Siguiri  district  sediments:  a  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  interpreted  to  progressively  evolve  into  transpression and then transtension (D3S), and a NW-SE compression (D4S). || CHAPTER 4: PAPER THREE  MINERALISATION FOOTPRINTS AND REGIONAL TIMING  OF THE SIGUIRI OROGENIC GOLD DISTRICT (GUINEA,  WEST AFRICA)  The following paper focuses on deposit to microscopic scale observations and presents  the  petrographic  and  geochemical  characteristics  of  the  Siguiri  district  and  of  its  gold  mineralisation. This study is based on field observations, drill core logging, petrography, geochemistry  and  in situ analyses by LA-ICP-MS of sulphide  minerals acquired  in  three  key deposits of the  Siguiri district. For each deposit, a log, a cross-section and numerous polished thin-sections are  presented. Based  on  this  work,  gold  mineralisation  characteristics  were  found  to  be  consistent  across the different deposits making the Siguiri district. Gold mineralisation in the district was  found to be  polyphase  and  to have  occurred mainly  during D3S,  but  was  interpreted to have  also occurred during D4S deformation. The timing of gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district is  also  constrained  in  this  study  and  compared  with  gold  mineralisation  events  from  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton. || CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS  4D EVOLUTION OF THE SIGUIRI DISTRICT –  IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WEST AFRICAN CRATON AND  GOLD EXPLORATION  This  thesis  presents  an  integrated  lithostratigraphic, geochronological,  structural  and  geochemical study of the Siguiri district and of its hosting sedimentary basin, the Siguiri Basin. Eleven deposits from the district were studied as well as a number of key locations across the  Basin. A  wide  variety  of  datasets,  tools  and  analytical  techniques  were  used,  ranging  from  fieldwork and the taking of structural readings to in-situ LA-ICP-MS. The work was organised  to:  1)  characterise  the  Siguiri  Basin  lithostratigraphy  and  its  tectonic  context  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny;  2)  determine  the  controls  on  gold  mineralisation  affecting  the  Siguiri  district, 3) understand the evolution of the Siguiri district and its current architecture, and; 4)  characterise the district mineralisation and footprint. The major findings of this thesis and their  implications  in  the  understanding  of  the  West  African  Craton  formation  and  for  gold  exploration are detailed below. 214 || Comparison  of  the  sedimentary  facies  and  geochronology of the Siguiri sediments with other metasedimentary basins in the West African  Craton,  suggests  that  the  Kintinian  Formation  is  part  of  the  Lower  Tarkwa  Group  sediments  commonly  described  as  “late  orogenic  basin”  sediments. The  Kintinian  olistostromes  are  inferred to highlight the onset of renewed tectonic activity associated with the first phases of  compression  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  in  the  Siguiri  Basin  at  ca. 2115  Ma. The  peculiar  morphology  of  this  olistostrome,  compared  to  the  bulk  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  sediments,  illustrates  a  major  change  in  lithofacies. This  change  is  interpreted  to  have  developed  along  WNW-ESE,  N-S  and  NE-SW  oriented  fundamental  basement  structures,  controlling  the  early  architecture of the Siguiri Basin as well as the location of world-class gold mineralisation in the  Siguiri district. These WNW-ESE, N-S and NE-SW fundamental structures are thought to have  acted  as  the  first  order  fluid  pathways  during  the  E-W  progressive  compressional  event  responsible for orogenic gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district. || Comparison of the characteristics and timing of gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  with  other  gold  deposits  from  the  West  African  Craton  indicates that gold mineralisation in Siguiri is coeval with mineralisation in other gold deposits. However,  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  in  the  West  African  Craton  are  associated  with  later  gold events that may have formed economic concentrations in the rest of the Siguiri Basin. The  conclusions  from  this  multi-scale  multi-disciplinary  work  have  implications  for  exploration targeting in and around the Siguiri Basin. This thesis highlights the importance of  the early architecture as a first order control on orogenic gold systems. The expression of the  second  and  third  order  structures  controlling  the  mineralisation  are  thought  to  develop  in  response  to  regional stress-switches  that  can  be  recognised  in  the  field. Finally,  at  a  deposit  scale, high grade zones can be targeted by geochemistry. || Conclusion  The clastic sediment-hosted orogenic gold deposits of Siguiri, in northeast Guinea, are  primarily  hosted  in  the  greywacke  of  the  Fatoya  Formation  and  to  lesser  extents  in  the  turbidites  of  adjacent  Balato  and  Kintinian  Formations. The  district  has  been  the  site  of  a  protracted and polyphase deformation divided into four local deformation stages (D1S to D4S),  all of which are attributed to Eburnean orogenesis. D1S was a cryptic N-S compressional event. The  main  deformation  event  D2S,  was  an  E-W  to  ENE-WSW  directed  compressional  event  responsible  for  the  bulk  of  the  deformation  affecting  the  Siguiri  Basin  metasediments. D3S  represents  a  progressive  evolution  of  D2S  compression  into  an  E-W  transpressional  event,  evolving into a transient period of NNW-SSE transtension. This latter episode of deformation is  associated with the bulk of veining observed in the Siguiri district and is also the main stage of  mineralization. || D1S deformation is interpreted to have been linked to N-S compression, but with inconclusive  outcrop exposures the understanding of this early deformation remains unclear. An alternative  interpretation is that the F1S folds represent syn-sedimentary slump folds (McClay, 1992), but  the  consistent  orientation  and  fold  axes  (accounting  for  overprinting  by  subsequent  events)  more  strongly  supports  a  tectonic  contractional  setting  for  this  folding. This  first  phase  of  deformation  may  be  responsible  for  the  early  albitisation  of  the  host  rock  across  the  Siguiri  district. D2S:  The second deformation is associated with the formation of major folds (F2S) and  associated D2S thrust faults (e.g., at Sanu Tinti and Kosise; Figure  18A and 18C). This event is  responsible for the bulk of the folding in the metasedimentary rocks and for the N-S structural  grain affecting much of the Siguiri Basin. F2S fold axial planes typically strike NNE-SSW to NNW- SSE,  and  their  fold  axes  plunge  at  variable  angles,  and  are  typically  steeper  in  the  Balato  Formation compared to the Fatoya Formation. || DEFORMATION EVENTS    Four  deformation  events  were  recognized  to  affect  the  sediments  of  the  Siguiri  district:  a  cryptic  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  to  ENE-WSW  compression  (D2S)  that  is  interpreted  as  progressively  evolving  into  a  transpression  (early-D3S)  and  then  into  a  NNW-SSE  transtension  (late-D3S),  and  finally  a  NW-SE  compression  (D4S).   The D1S deformation event is mainly characterized by F1S recumbent folds with E-W  to  NW-SE  and  NE-SW  striking  axial  traces. A  discreet  S1S  cleavage,  shallowly  to  moderately dipping to the WSW was locally observed in the northernmost part of  the Siguiri district.   The  D2S  deformation  event  is  responsible  for  the  N-S  structural  grain  observed  across the Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin. This event is characterised by F2S upright  folds  with  NNE-SSW  to  NNW-SSE  striking  axial  planes  that  refolds  F1S  folds  and  create  fold  interference  patterns. While  no  axial  planar  cleavage  was  found  associated with the F2S folds, bedding parallel and en-echelon V2S veins developed  during flexural slip along these fold hinges. || Davis,  2002;  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  2015;  Figure  47). This  younger  episode  of  magmatism,  dated  between  ca. 2085-2054  Ma,  is  coeval  with  the  second  episode  of  gold  mineralisation,  recognized in the deposits of Loulo in the KKI, Morila in Mali, as well as Damang and Obuasi in  Ghana (Fougerouse et al., 2015; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; McFarlane et al., 2011). In  comparison,  the  Siguiri  district  syn-D3S  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  (V3A  and  V3B  veining)  was  overprinted  by  a  latter  phase  of  gold  mineralisation  or  remobilisation,  syn-D4S. The D4S deformation was responsible for the development of the NNE-SSW S4S cleavage, sub- parallel  to  the  sub-solidus  fabric  observed  in  the  Malea  monzogranite,  outcropping  to  the  north of the district (Figure 32) and emplaced along with the Saraya volcanic breccia during the  first  episode  of  magmatism  discussed  above  (Figure  47). Based  on  the orientation  of  the  S4S  cleavage and sub-solidus fabric in the Malea monzogranite, we interpret the emplacement of  this  intrusive  and  of  the  Saraya  volcanic  breccia  as  coeval  with  the  formation  of  the  S4S  cleavage  recognized  in  the  Siguiri  district. || Discussion  Structural event history  The  field  relationships  documented  in  the  Siguiri  district  suggest  a  polyphase  deformation history. All structural elements documented in the Siguiri district can be grouped  in 4 sequential deformation events that have been termed D1S, D2S, D3S, and D4S. Within these  events, 3 distinct folding events and 3 distinct veining events can be determined (Figure  25),  allowing  the  relative  timing  and  geometric  controls  on  mineralization  to  be  placed  into  the  overall structural evolution of the district. Figure 25: Summary table of the deformation events and timing of the structural features recognized at Siguiri in this  study with the work from Milési et al. (1989, 1992), Miller et al. (2013) and Steyn (2012). || Dr Stanislav Ulrich spent the most time  with the candidate on the field and contributed to the overall interpretation of the structural  evolution  of  the  Siguiri  district. Dr  John  Miller  also  contributed  to  this  interpretation  and  provided numerous fruitful discussions regarding stress-switches in orogenic gold deposits. Drs  Nicolas Thébaud, and Campbell T. McCuaig also largely contributed in the revisions done to the  manuscript and by providing insightful discussions. The manuscript  presented in Chapter four is first  authored by the candidate and co- authored by Nicolas Thébaud, John Miller, Malcolm Roberts and Noreen Evans. The candidate  undertook  all  sampling,  sample  preparation,  optical  microscopy,  whole-rock  geochemical  analyses  and  writing  of  the  manuscript. || Early Au-Sb-Bi-(Te-W) mineralisation at the Morila deposit in Southeast Mali (McFarlane et al.,  2011)  is  categorised  as  intrusion-related  but  is  overprinted  by  As-Au-Ag  orogenic  style  mineralisation. This late overprint is hosted along a NNE-trending shear zone. Mineralisation is  characterised by disseminated arsenopyrite containing polygonal gold blebs and is associated  with  albitisation  and  the  development  of  titanite. Mineralisation  in  the  Obuasi  gold  mine  in  Ghana (Fougerouse et al., 2015) is similar to that in the Siguiri district. Mineralisation in Obuasi  is  structurally  controlled  and  displays  two  distinct  textures:  disseminated  gold-bearing  sulphides  (predominantly  arsenopyrite  in  shale)  and  quartz-carbonate  veins  associated  with  native  gold. Obuasi  mineralisation  is  also  associated  with  chlorite-quartz  and  carbonate  alteration (e.g. || Even  though  all  these  studies  propose  that  gold  mineralisation  in  Siguiri  is  dominantly  controlled by veins, no consensus was reached by the authors on what controls the location of  the Siguiri gold district at the scale of the Siguiri Basin or what controls the extent of the ore  shoots at the district and deposit scales. To  further  the  understanding  of  the  characteristics,  geometry  and  genesis  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district,  a  multi-scale  and  multidisciplinary  approach  was  employed. This  approach  addresses  the  various  scales  at  which  geological  processes  work  in  gold  mineral  systems. Modern  gold  exploration  strategies  increasingly  rely  on  such  an  approach,  involving  integration  of  fieldwork,  geophysics,  and  geochemistry  among  other  techniques, used at different scales (McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; McCuaig et al., 2010; Robert  et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2010; Williams and Currie, 1993; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Blewett  et  al.,  2010;  Goldfarb  et  al.,  2005;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Groves  et  al.,  2000;  Neumayr  et  al.,  2008; Eilu and Groves, 2001; Eilu et al., 1999). At a province scale, numerous studies highlight  the role of early architecture as a primary control on gold mineralisation (Robert et al., 2005;  Miller et al., 2010; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Chapter two). Down one  scale at the  district  level,  secondary  structures  control  and/or  host  gold  mineralisation  (Blewett  et  al.,  2010;  32 || Fieldwork was undertaken in eleven deposits of the Siguiri district. Particular attention  was  given  to  the  Sintroko  PB1,  Kosise,  Kami,  Bidini  and  Sanu  Tinti  deposits  due  to  their  structural  complexity,  lithostratigraphic  position,  outcropping  conditions  and  accessibility. Work  was  focused  on  structural  mapping,  lithofacies  recognition,  core  logging,  geochemical  sampling, GIS and 3D modelling. In addition to the data collected in the Siguiri district, regional  fieldwork was also carried out in the rest of the Siguiri Basin for geochronological sampling and  regional mapping. Regional  and  district  scale  geochronological  sampling  and  lithofacies  observations  indicate  that  the  central  Siguiri  Basin  is  of  Lower  Tarkwa  Group  age  (ca. 2015  Ma)  and  deposited  late  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny. || Figure  15:  Simplified  lithostratigraphic  and  geochronological  chart  of  some  key  areas  of  the  West  African  Craton.

Discussion  Depositional environments of the Siguiri district  The  very  fine-grained  size  of  the  Balato  Formation  deposits  suggests  deposition  in  a  low energy, marine or lake setting. The dominantly dark colour of the Balato shales suggests  high content in organic material and deposition in reduced water oxygenation and circulation  (relatively quiescent phase of sedimentation). The  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Fatoya  Formation  are  interpreted  as  the  product  of  submarine, sediment-laden gravity flows waning through time (Mulder and Alexander, 2001). || Figure 16: A) Simplified geology map of the Southern West African Craton.

After Chapter 3. Sampling  was  focused  in  these  five  key  deposits  and  organised  to  cover  the  main  lithotypes (greywacke, shale and conglomerate) inside and outside of the ore zones. Sampling  for  whole-rock  multi-element  geochemistry  was  focused  in  the  Kosise  deposit. For  more  details on sampling, see the methodology sections of Chapters two and four. Regional  fieldwork  was  first  conducted  in  the  first  hundred  kilometres  around  the  Siguiri  district. || Figure 46: Paragenetic sequence for the Siguiri district. The  mineralogy  of  the  host-rock  in  the  Siguiri  district  is  dominated  by  plagioclase,  quartz  and  shows  moderate  to  intense  sericitisation  and  albitisation. Minor  biotite  and  chlorite,  possibly  detrital,  were  also  found  in  the  host  rock  mineral  assemblage  as  well  as  numerous  detrital  zircons  (dated  by  U-Pb  SHRIMP  geochronology;  Lebrun  et  al.,  in  review  2015b; Chapter 2). The first hydrothermal event occurs during D2S E-W compression and is characterised  by the development of the bedding-parallel and en-echelon V2S quartz-(ankerite) veins. The V2S  veins developed in response to flexural slip during F2S folding (Lebrun et al., in review 2015a;  Chapter 3) are associated with minor albite, sericite, pyrite and traces of rutile. These veins do  not present significative gold mineralisation and show little development of alteration around  their margins. || For this structural analysis stereograms of the paleo-orientation of  σ1, σ2 and σ3 were constructed for each measured conjugate vein set (Figure 31).

No spatial gradient was observed in the main stress orientations from north to south  or east to west throughout the Siguiri district. The main feature identified was that, at the time  of  veining,  σ3  remained  consistently  sub-horizontal  and  oriented  to  the  NNW. || Formation and Bambela Basin sediments in Burkina Faso, and Fingouana, Kabaya and Her’kono  Formations in Mali. All these  sedimentary rocks  are dominated by flysch-like  metasediments  (e.g. greywacke, argillite) deposited at ca. 2120 Ma (Figure 15; Davis et al., 2015). The Siguiri  district sedimentary rocks are therefore interpreted to have deposited at the same time than  that of the Lower Tarkwa Group deposited between 2110 and ca. 2095 Ma, or to represent the  last expression of Upper Birimian sedimentation dated as 2130-2110 Ma (Davis et al., 2015). || Geochronology  A  total  of  six  rock  samples  were  collected  in  the  Siguiri  Basin. Five  representative  detrital samples were selected for each interpreted lithostratigraphic Formation encountered  in the Siguiri district (Figure 5). An extra sample from a crosscutting volcanic lithology was also  sampled to the west of the district (Figure 3). Samples were collected from pit exposures, field  outcrop  or  drill  core. Around  3  to  5  kg  of  material  were  taken  for  most  samples,  but  conglomerate and brecciated samples had 10 kg of material sampled to compensate for their  larger grain-size. While most samples came from ore zone vicinities, each one was taken within  the least hydrothermally altered and weathered areas. || Geochronology  and  lithostratigraphy  of  the  Siguiri  district:  implications  for  gold  mineralisation in the Siguiri Basin (Guinea, West Africa)  Erwann  Lebrun1*,  Nicolas  Thébaud1,  John  Miller1,  Stanislav  Ulrich2,  Julien  Bourget3,  Ockert  Terblanche2  1:  Centre  for  Exploration  Targeting  and  ARC  Centre  of  Excellence  for  Core  to  Crust  Fluid  Systems,  School  of  Earth  and  Environment,  Robert  Street  Building,  M006,  The  University  of  Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA, 6009,  Australia  2: AngloGold Ashanti Ltd - Brownfields Exploration Technical Hub - Continental Africa Region,  44 St George Terrace, Perth, WA, 6000, Australia  3: Centre for Petroleum Geoscience and CO2 Sequestration, School of Earth and Environment,  M004, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA, 6009,  Australia  *: Corresponding author.

This  new  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the  central  part  of  the  Basin  further  highlights  first  order controls on the location of the world class Siguiri orogenic gold district. Three metasedimentary Formations occur in the Siguiri district, namely: the Balato, Fatoya and  Kintinian  Formations. These  consist  of  fine-grained  organic-rich  shales,  mudstone  and  siltstone/greywacke/limestone  interbeds,  decimetre  to  metre-thick  graded  greywacke  beds  and  debris  flow  deposits. The  Balato  Formation  displays  low-energy,  hemipelagic  marine  or  51 || Geological map and regional stratigraphic integration  The  field  and  drill  core  observations  were  integrated  with  the  geophysical  datasets  available over the Siguiri district. Airborne electromagnetic dataset (AEM):   The  variation  in  the  amount  of  conductive  material (e.g. shale)  in  the  different  units  has resulted in some important contrasts in the AEM response of the three major sedimentary  Formations observed in the district. The Kintinian Formation, dominated by shale is the most  responsive  (conductive)  in  AEM,  while  the  greywacke-dominated  Fatoya  Formation  shows  a  very  low  response  (least  conductive). The  Balato  Formation  AEM  response  returns  an  intermediate signal between that of the Fatoya and Kintinian Formation. Using these contrasts,  a  revised  map  of  the  Siguiri  district  was  made  (Figure  5A). || Gold mineralisation  was  interpreted  to  occur  late  during  D3S  around  ca. 2100  Ma  and  be  associated  with  stress- field  variations  happening  at  a  regional  scale. This  deformation  scheme  matches  that  of  the  deformation history previously described for the West African Craton. Not  only  is  this  work  crucial  for  the  understanding  of  the  deformation  events  that  affected the Siguiri district, but is also critical to highlight the role stress-field variations have as  a process leading to orogenic gold mineralisation. 100 || Goldfarb et al., 2001; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2010; Chapter three). Province- and  district-scale controlling structures are typically delineated using geophysical datasets (Blewett  et al., 2010; Chapter two) but can also be exposed by exploration geochemistry, especially at  smaller scale (e.g. deposit scale; Eilu and Groves, 2001; Eilu et al., 1999; Chapter four). The present study thus focuses on the detailed description of the geology and regional  framework  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district. The  results  of  this  study  presents  the  4D  (space-time)  evolution  of  the  Siguiri  district  lithostratigraphic  record,  structural  architecture,  and  mineral  alteration. Collectively,  the  data  recorded  during  the  course  of  this  study  provides  an  insight  into  the  tectonic  context,  genetic  processes  and  the  geochemical  footprint  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district. || High-grade  mineralisation  zones are associated with pyritisation, carbonate alteration and intense albitisation. Sintroko PB1  Lithostratigraphy and structure  Sintroko PB1 is one of the southernmost deposits of the Siguiri district and is hosted by  the Balato Formation (Figure 33). Rocks at Sintroko PB1 consist of centimetre- to decimetre- thick  beds  of  shale-siltstone  interlayered  with  medium  to  fine-grained  greywacke  and  sandstone beds. A distinctive 10 to 20 m thick black shale layer runs through the centre of the  deposit (Figure 35C and 39A). 179 || However, the full extent of  this  vein  set  remains  unclear  due  to  the  highly  weathered  nature  of  these  carbonate- dominated veins in the different deposits. The second vein set associated with these faults, V3B (Figure 20D), represents the bulk  of  veining  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  crosscuts  the  V2S  and  V3A  vein  sets. Despite  substantial  variations  in  the  orientation  of  S0,  the  orientation  of  this  quartz-ankerite- arsenopyrite-(pyrite) vein set remains constant throughout the Siguiri district (Figure 26I, 26J,  26K  and  26L),  and  clearly  overprints  the  first  (F1S)  and  second  (F2S)  folding  generations. Oriented  around  170/35  (V3B  shallow)  and  160/70  (V3B  steep;  Figure  26I,  26J,  26K  and  26L),  both  average  vein  orientations  display  a  hybrid/conjugate  geometry  (McClay,  1992). These  geometries are formed by conjugate V3B shallow veins or conjugate V3B steep veins. In addition both  these geometries can be found mutually cross-cutting each other in the field (Figure 21C, 23B,  23C,  23D  and  28I  to  28K). || However, trace element signatures of  sulphides  can  also  be  used  to  distinguish  between  different  sulphide  generations  associated  with multiple hydrothermal events (Zhao et al., 2011). The  wide  diversity  of  gold  mineralisation  types  recorded  in  the  West  African  Craton  such as intrusion related gold (McFarlane et al., 2011), orogenic gold (Lawrence et al., 2013a;  Fougerouse  et  al., in press; Allibone et al., 2002; Oberthür et  al., 1998), paleoplacers (Hirdes  and  Nunoo,  1994; Davis et  al.,  1994),  Cu-Au  porphyry  (Béziat et  al.,  2013),  renders  essential  the detailed petrographic and geochemical characterisation of a deposit to resolve its nature  (or footprint). In turn, this footprint can become a backbone for exploration strategies. This study focuses on characterisation of the mineral assemblages and mineralisation  in three key deposits of the world-class orogenic gold Siguiri district (Guinea, West Africa) and  its  geochemical  and  petrological  footprints. The  Siguiri  district  is  the  only  large  (>  50  t  Au)  160 || Hydrothermal  activity  in  the  Siguiri  district  is  mainly  characterised  by  veining  developed during D2S E-W compression and late-D3S NNW-SSE transtension. Veining developed  during  D2S  is  expressed  as  bedding  parallel  and  en-echelon  V2S  vein  arrays  (Figure  34)  interpreted to have developed by flexural slip along bedding during F2S folding (Lebrun et al., in  review 2015a; Chapter 3). The V2S veins are crosscut by the V3S veins developed late during D3S  transtension along the early-D3S faults. Based on drill core observations, two different vein sets  were identified: V3A and V3B (Figure 34). The V3A vein set commonly has brecciated textures and  varies  significantly  in  orientation  across  the  district  (Figure  34C). The  second  vein  set,  V3B,  crosscut  both  V2S  and  V3A  sets  but  is  overprinted  by  S4S. || In  the  1980s, North American and British companies conducted reconnaissance mapping, traversing,  and  sampling. In  the  early  1990s,  Société  Aurifère  de  Guinée  followed  up  this  work  and  reported a production of 1.1 t Au. In 1995, Golden Shamrock started a pre-feasibility study of  the  Siguiri  district,  before  merging  with  Ashanti  Goldfields  (now  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd)  in  1996. Since 2004, the Siguiri mine has been owned 85% by AngloGold Ashanti Ltd and 15% by  109 || In  the  3rd  century,  the  Sarakolle  Kingdom  was  already  familiar  with  the  widespread  gold  endowment  from  Senegal  to  the  Niger  River. Production  of  gold  from  this  region is thought to have continued through the 12th and 13th centuries in areas controlled by  the  Mindingo  Kingdom,  whose  capital  Niani  is  near  the  present  eastern  border  between  Guinea and Mali, less than 100 km from Siguiri. Continued gold production included its use as  tribute  by  the  Mali  Empire  during  the  17th  century. In  the  late  19th  and  early  20th  century,  minor  extraction  and  prospecting  in  the  Siguiri  area  was  started  by  the  French. Industrial  production of gold from the Siguiri district started in 1931 (nearly 75 t reported between 1931  and 1951)  (AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., 2013). Between 1960 and  1963 a Russian state  company  was  actively  mining  in  the  region,  focusing  their  operations  on  placer-type  deposits. || In  the  Siguiri  district,  such  structures  were  not  observed. Instead,  strike-slip  and  dip-slip  movements  were  accommodated along the four different orientations of faults observed throughout the district. Field  data  from  the  Siguiri  district  indicate  that  dip-slip  movements  (or  pure  shear  component) were accommodated by the N-S thrust faults, these structures dominantly border  the low-strain central part of the Siguiri district (Fatoya formation). Strike-slip movements (or  simple  shear  component)  were  accommodated  by  the  NE-SW  dextral  shear  zones  and  the  140 || In terms of gold exploration, this thesis highlights the necessity of using a multi-scale  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  to  understand  the  genesis  and  controls  affecting  world-class  orogenic  gold  districts. In the  case  of  the  Siguiri  district,  the  new  understanding  of  the  early  architecture  of  the  Siguiri Basin  emphasises  the  role  it  played  as  a  first  order  control on  the  location of the Siguiri district. This conclusion emphasises the importance of understanding the  overall  tectonic  history  of  a  province  to  aid  mineral  exploration. Geochronology,  geophysics  and structural geology are crucial tools to be used during this first step. Down one scale to the  Siguiri  Basin  to  district  scale,  second  and  third  order  structures  can  be  targeted  through  the  use  of  geophysics,  structural  geology  and  to  some  extent,  geochemistry. At  a  deposit  scale,  218 || Introduction  Orogenic gold mineralization is common across the Paleoproterozoic Birimian rocks of  the West African Craton e.g. Lawrence et al., (2013a); Milési et al. (1989); Milési et al., (1992). The  location  of  orogenic  gold  deposits  is  typically  controlled  by  complex  regional-scale  fault  networks (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2000). In West Africa, the Ashanti fault system in  Ghana, is one example of such a network, and its many faults host some of the biggest vein- hosted  and  fault-vein-hosted  orogenic  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Obuasi,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002;  Fougerouse  et  al.,  this  volume). The  Siguiri  district  (240  t/7.9  Moz;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  2013;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  n.d.)  is  unusual  in  West  Africa  because  it  is  not  located  on  a  recognized  large  regional  scale  fault  system. || It  also  discusses  the  use  of  laser  ablation  to  constrain the timing of mineralisation and the polyphase nature of hydrothermal  activity  and  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  in  the  rest  of  the  West  African Craton;   5)  a  conclusion  (Chapter  five)  that  summarizes  the  main  findings  of  this  thesis  and  introduces the remaining questions to answer and possible future work. The  three  papers  form  the  separate  parts  of  a  coherent  study  on  the  Siguiri  district  litho-structural  and  hydrothermal  evolution  and  that  of  its  host  basin  in  the  context  of  the  West African craton and the Eburnean orogeny. The overall scope of this study zooms in from  a  regional  scale  in  Chapter  two,  to  a  district  scale  in  Chapter  three,  to  a  deposit  scale  in  Chapter four, emphasizing the multi-scale approach of this work. Each chapter is linked to the  previous  by  a  brief  introductive  paragraph  explaining  how  the  overall  study  evolves  and  benefits from the following work. 38 || Key deposits of the Siguiri district  The following section reviews the main geological characteristics and insights into the  mineralization of five key deposits from the Siguiri district: Bidini, Sanu Tinti, Kosise, Kami and  Sintroko PB1 (Figure 17). Bidini  The  Bidini  deposit  is  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the  district  (Figure  17). Bidini  is  hosted  in  the  greywacke-dominated  Fatoya  Formation,  and  is  adjacent  to  the  Sanu  Tinti  111 || LITHOSTRATIGRAPHY AND TECTONICS    The Siguiri district is hosted in three distinct sedimentary Formations. From east to  west: the Balato, Fatoya and Kintinian Formations.   The Kintinian Formation is stratigraphically on top of the Fatoya Formation, itself  overlying the Balato Formation.   The  three Formations are mainly derived from granitic rocks dated at  around ca. 2015 Ma.   The Balato and Fatoya Formations and their facies association are characteristic of  a  basal  regressive  sequence,  whereas  the  overlying  Kintinian  Formation  display  stacks  of  polymict  conglomerate  interpreted  to  be  the  product  of  debris  flow  events. || Lebrun,  E.,  Miller,  J.,  Thébaud,  N.,  Ulrich,  S.,  and  McCuaig,  C.,  in  review  2015a,  Structural  controls  on  an  orogenic  gold  system:  The  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district,  Siguiri  Basin,  Guinea, West Africa: Economic Geology.

Stacks of polymict conglomerate in the Kintinian Formation,  interpreted  to  be  olistostrome  deposits,  were  interpreted  as  marking  the  onset  of  the  Eburnean  compression  and  highlight  the  early  architecture  and  fundamental  structures  5 || Magnetic dataset:   The magnetic datasets, were used to delineate regional features but were of no use to  distinguish between the three sedimentary Formations at the scale of the Siguiri district. At a  regional  scale,  the  magnetic  datasets  were  used  to  highlight  dykes,  structures  and  to  follow  the conglomeratic base of the Kintinian Formation throughout the entire Siguiri Basin (Figure  10). Figure  10: Geological map of the Siguiri Basin overlain by the magnetics analytical signal and showing the spatial  continuity of the magnetic conglomerates throughout the Basin (highlighted in red). The WSW-striking and WNW- striking magnetic highs, respectively found in the northern and southern parts of the Basin are dykes (Figure 4). This  unit  shows  a  stronger  magnetic  response  than  the  rest  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  sedimentary rocks and forms a distinctive “Z”-shape from the Siguiri district to the south of the  city of Kankan (Figure 10). Ground-truthing of this geophysical observation indicates a strong  magnetite alteration of the conglomerate in the southern part of the Siguiri Basin and lateral  70 || Mesozoic sills, lava flows and ENE- striking dikes, which are related to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean, also cut or overlie  rocks of the basin (Abouchami et al. 1990; Paranhos 2008, unpublished; Egal et al., 1999; Egal  et al., 2002). The  Siguiri  district  is  hosted  in  fine-grained  organic-rich  shale,  siltstone,  greywacke  interbeds,  graded  greywacke  beds  and  rare  conglomerate. Based  on  aeromagnetics,  magnetics,  gravimetry,  drill  core  and  field  observations,  3  formations  were  recognized,  namely:  the  Balato,  Fatoya  and  Kintinian  Formations  (Figure  17). The  Balato  Formation  is  dominated  by  dark  grey  siltstone  beds  grading  upwards  to  shale. The  contact  between  the  Balato  and  the  overlying  Fatoya  Formation  was  not  observed. || Methodology  Field approach and sampling  Field approach  Structural elements and controls on gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district are very  consistent  from  one  deposit  to the next  (Lebrun et al., in review  2015a; Chapter 3). For this  reason, key deposits were selected based on the formation and host rocks, the understanding  of the deposit structural framework, and the accessibility to fresh outcrops and core intersects. Three  deposits  were  identified  as  representative  of  the  Siguiri  district  mineralisation:  the  Bidini, Kosise and Sintroko PB1 deposits (Figure 33). General sampling  Sampling was designed to: 1) constrain the paragenesis of the district; 2) characterise  the geochemical halo associated with a representative mineralised shear zone; 3) compare the  geochemical changes between formations and host rocks, and; 4) compare the sulphide major  and trace elements and gold content of each vein generation and hydrothermal events. A total  of 37 representative fresh rock samples were collected. Due to the weathering profile reaching  depths  over  200  m,  drill  core  logging  was  conducted  and  used  to  guide  sampling. || Minor  free  gold  concentrations  are  still  being  extracted  by  local  miners  from  localized Phanerozoic paleo-placers and from hydromorphic reconcentration in and below the  mottled  zone  of  the  lateritic  profile. Individual  gold  nuggets  of  up  to  several  kilograms  in  weight have been found near regolith surface (Watts, 2010). Methodology  For  the  purpose  of  this  paper,  each  of  the  eleven  open  pits  is  considered  a  deposit,  they  are  collectively  termed  the  Siguiri  district,  and  the  overall  district  is  considered  world- class  (>6  Moz  Au;  Schodde  and  Hronsky,  2006). A  few  deposits  of  the  district  were  not  accessible at the time the fieldwork was conducted, and as a result few data could be collected  from them (e.g. Sokunu; Figure 17). Out of the eleven deposits accessible that were visited and  mapped, five deposits were defined as being of key importance for the understanding of the  overall  district  architecture  and  mineralization  style. || Orogenic gold deposits are displayed as small red discs.

(1989) and Miller et al. || Prior to the switch, fluids are stored under  high  pressure  in  the  rock  mass  and  fluid  mobility  and  veining  are  minor. When  the  switch  occurs, a stress threshold is overcome allowing the barrier to be breached and fluids to flow  into an organized vein network. Geodynamic interpretation and drivers of stress-switches  Drivers of the different stress-switches observed in the Siguiri district may have a local  cause, including: 1) continuous local overburden build up; 2) fault irregularities; 3) earthquake  focal  behaviour  dynamics,  or  4)  a  regional  scale mechanism,  such  as  plate  convergence  rate  drop (Upton and Craw, 2013; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Beroza and Zoback, 1993). However, stress- switches  have  been  documented  in  many  other  orogenic  gold  systems  around  the  world,  including Archean examples (Bouiller and Robert, 1992;  Holyland and Ojala, 1997; Nguyen et  al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; e.g. in the Yilgarn: the Waroonga  and  New-Holland-Genesis  deposits,  Thébaud  et  al.,  2013). In  the  Birimian  of  West  Africa,  stress-switches have been recognised as one of the crucial triggers for mineralization in several  gold  deposits  (Ashanti  in  Ghana,  Sadiola,  Loulo  and  possibly  Morila  in  Mali,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a;  Masurel  et  al.,  this  volume;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011). || Pure  and  simple  shear  are  accommodated  along  distinct  thrust  faults  and  strike-slip  faults,  respectively;  C)  Simplified  map  view  of  the  decoupled  early-D3S  transpression  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district. Formation and deposit colors as in Figure 17. 141 || Results  The Siguiri district lithostratigraphy  The Siguiri district lithostratigraphy consists of a thick (>400 m) sedimentary sequence  metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  facies. Overall,  the  metasediments  mostly  consist  of  normally  graded  to  massive,  dm  to  m-thick  greywacke  beds  interbedded  with  claystone- siltstone, and shale (Figure 6, 7, 8, 9). In  detail,  the  lithostratigraphy  of  the  Siguiri  district  was  divided  into  three  distinct  sedimentary Formations (Figure 9; Watts, 2010). These Formations are, from older to younger:  the  Balato,  Fatoya  and  Kintinian  Formations. A  schematic  log  representing  the  lithostratigraphic column of the Siguiri gold district is presented on Figure 9. 62 || Results of paleostress analysis on conjugate vein sets on mineralized vein sets that formed late  during  D3S  indicate  that  the  stress-field  ranged  from  extensional  to  strike-slip,  sometimes  within  the  same  vein  locality. The  late-D3S  deformation  is  interpreted  to  have  been  a  transtensional event. The first change in the principal stress axes orientation is interpreted to  be related to a continuous switch from a far field-dominated to a body force-dominated stress  field  reducing  the  deviatoric  component  on  the  stress  tensor. The  second  change  in  the  principal stress axes orientation from early-D3S transpression to late-D3S transtension, suggests  that 1 and 2 were close in magnitude, which is inferred to have facilitated localized stress- switches. In  the  Siguiri  district,  the  early-D3S  and  late-D3S  stress-switches  which  occurred  at  both a local and regional scale, have enhanced fracture permeability and are seen as a critical  element  for  the establishment  of  active  fluid  pathways  leading  to  the  formation  of  a  world- class gold system.

Late chloritisation can also be observed along minor sub-vertical N-S  brecciated zones a few meters long. Sintroko PB1  Sintroko PB1 is one of the southernmost deposits of the Siguiri district (Figure 17). It is  hosted in the Balato formation, and is dominated by centimeter- to meter-scale alternations of  shale and siltstone beds. Beds of fine to medium greywacke can also be found in Sintroko PB1  and the central area of the deposit is dominated by black shale. The deposit  sits on two open anticlines  separated by an  area of sheared sub-vertical  NNW-SSE trending bedding in the centre of the deposit (Figure 18D). || Since no least altered shale and greywacke could be sampled  directly  in  the  Kintinian  Formation,  Kintinian  samples  BD1  and  BD4  were  normalised  to  a  sample of shale and greywacke representative of the Siguiri district. The Fatoya samples F and  O  were  therefore  chosen  for  the  normalisation  of  BD1  and  BD4,  respectively. Geochemical  data were plotted using ioGAS. 171 || Strain partitioning between the three stratigraphic formations recognized in the Siguiri  district resulted in a heterogeneous strain  distribution in the district. In the  shale-dominated  Balato and Kintinian Formations the strain is intense and the observed folds tend to be tight to  isoclinal. By  contrast,  the  Fatoya  Formation  is  dominated  by  a  greywacke-sandstone  association, which displays a lower strain intensity characterized by open folds (Figure 17). As a  result  of  this  competency  contrast,  bedding  orientations  can  be  found  to  be  locally  quite  variable (Figure 17, 26A, 26B, 26C and 26D). 128 || Stress-field evolution during D2S and early-D3S  Based  on  the  structural  elements  observed,  and  their  relative  timing,  a  stress-field  reconstruction was undertaken in the Siguiri district for the syn-D2S ductile and early- to late- D3S brittle part of the deformation history. Paleo-stress reconstruction for the syn-D2S ductile  part  of  the  deformation  history,  was  based  on  the  geometry  of  the  F2S  folds  and  the  orientations  of  their  axial  planes. The  reconstruction  of  the  paleo-stress  orientations  for  the  D3S  brittle  part  of  the  deformation  history  was  based  on  fault  and  V3B  conjugate  vein  orientations  assuming  that  locally,  the  Andersonian  fault  and  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  models  prevailed at the time of faulting and that all V3B conjugate veins were not following pre-existing  structures. The orientation of σ1 was reconstructed as bisecting the acute angle between two  conjugate  veins,  while  σ2  lays  at  their  intersection  and  σ3  bisects  the  obtuse  angle  the  conjugate  makes  (Anderson,  1951;  McClay,  1992). This  analysis  was  only  based  on  V3B  conjugate sets across the whole district since data from the V3A vein set were insufficient. The D2S E-W compressional event, highlighted by the N-S trending F2S fold axial planes,  indicates it was related to a horizontal main stress axis (σ1) and a vertical σ3, or overburden  pressure  (Figure  29A). || Structural  controls  on  an  orogenic  gold  system:  The  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district,  Siguiri  Basin, Guinea, West Africa  Erwann Lebrun1, John Miller1, Nicolas Thébaud1, Stanislav Ulrich2, T.

Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || The  overprinting  gold  mineralisation  event  recognized  Craton-wide  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma  is  not  represented in the Siguiri district but represents the main source of gold in other deposits of  the  West  African  Craton  (e.g. Morila,  Loulo,  Sadiola). This  study  support  the  idea  that  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri and in West Africa is polyphase and that careful consideration of the  Siguiri district mineralisation timings could lead to future gold discovery in the Siguiri Basin. 204 || The  progressive  evolution  from  a  far  field  stress  dominated  to  a  body  forces  dominated  environment,  whose  local  expression  in  the  Siguiri  district  ranges  from  the  early  increase  in  overburden  pressure  to  the  late  syn-gold  transtensional  deformation,  is  responsible  for  the  reduction of the deviatoric component of the stress tensor (Engelder, 1994). 145 || The  veins  that  developed  along  these  structures  are  commonly  found  to  be  conjugate  and  their  orientation  is  consistent  with  a  transtensional  deformation. These  late-D3S  veins  are  overprinted  by  the  sub-vertical  NE-SW  striking  S4S  cleavage  that  characterises  the  D4S  deformation event. Based on finite strain analysis of D2S structural elements and paleo stress- field  reconstruction  from  early-D3S  faults  and  late-D3S  conjugate  veins,  two  stress-switches  were identified in the Siguiri district. These stress-switches are also documented at a regional  scale and highlight the homogenisation of the stress-tensor prior to gold mineralisation. This  process is postulated to occur in numerous orogenic gold deposits around the world and may  be a pre-requisite for orogenic gold mineralisation. Deposit  to  microscopic  scale  work  indicate  that  hydrothermal  activity  in  the  Siguiri  district was polyphase and that gold mineralisation developed over three distinct periods. || The  E-W  compression  D2S  evolves progressively to a transtension responsible for gold mineralisation in Siguri, D3S. After the work from Lebrun  et al. (in review 2015); Chapter 3. While  D1S  deformation  is  cryptic  and  its  E-W  folds  discreet,  D2S  E-W  compression  is  associated with the bulk of the deformation observed in the Siguiri district and is responsible  for the N-S structural grain of the Siguiri Basin. Finite strain analysis of the ductile and brittle  structural  elements  associated  with  D2S  and  D3S  (e.g. folds,  faults,  veins)  indicates  multiple  stress-switches. || The  Saraya  area  is  located  ~50  km  west  of  the  Siguiri  district  (area  around  sample  Si327 on Figure  3B). The  lithostratigraphy in the Saraya  area is similar to that of the district,  displaying  fine  micaceous  greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale  beds  alike  of  those  of  the  Balato,  Fatoya and Kintinian Formations. In AEM, the Saraya area shows a low response similar to that  of the Fatoya Formation. The Saraya metasediments are however overlain unconformably by  67 || The  V3B  vein  set  displays  conjugate  geometries,  with  individual  veins  dipping  steeply  or  moderately  to  the  SE. This  vein  set  represents the main source of gold mined in the Siguiri district. 165 || The  change  from  syn-D2S  compression  (σ1  >  σ2  >  σ3;  Figure  29A)  to  early-D3S  transpression (Figure 29B) may be linked to a progressive increase in the overburden pressure  (σ3),  or  an  increase  in  the  amount  of  NW-SE  extension  due  to  changes  in  far  field  stresses. Either  of  these  processes  are  interpreted  to  have  caused  a  stress  switch  that  rendered  σ3  approximately equal to σ2, eventually leading to a change in the σ3 orientation (Figure  29B). This allowed the formation (and reactivation) of the four different fault orientations. Localized stress switches associated with late-D3S mineralized veining  In  addition  to  the  district-scale  stress-switch  from  D2S  compressional  to  early-D3S  transpressional deformation, there is evidence for more localized stress-switches in the Siguiri  district. These  have  been inferred based on the  analysis of individual V3B  conjugate vein sets  that  have  mainly  developed  along  the  faults  observed  throughout  the  district. The  V3B  conjugate vein sets were found to be mutually cross-cutting each other in the field (Figure 21C,  23C, 28C, 28F, 28I and 28J). || The  domes  and  basins  most  notably  developed  in  the  Kami  deposit,  could  therefore  have  developed  by  overprinting  of  the  F2S  N-S  folds  by  the  D4S  NW-SE  compression. The  V3B  mineralized veins located in these domes suggest that these domes developed pre- to syn-D3S  veining and thus cannot have formed by F2S/F4S interference. However, D4S may have amplified  the domes and basins. The S4S  dip angle and dip  direction varies  across the Siguiri district, from sub-vertical  and ESE- to WNW-dipping in the south, to shallowly SE-dipping in the north. Variations in S4S  dip angle and dip direction in the northern part of the district are interpreted to be related to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  the  rotation  of  cleavage  trajectories  around  these  structures,  a  mechanism described by Dewey et al. (1998). || The  last  deformation  event,  D4S,  was  a  NE-SW  compressional  event  which  created  a  penetrative  cleavage  in  the  entire  rock  mass  and  is  post  the  main  stage  of  mineralization at Siguiri. The orogenic gold mineralization in the Siguiri district is associated with two principal  vein types: 1) early gold-rich pyrite and ankerite brecciated veins proximal to NW-SE structures  and  2)  crosscutting  quartz-carbonate-arsenopyrite  conjugate  veins. The  second,  and  most  common  vein  type,  is  preferentially  developed  along  four  orientations  of  discrete  faults  or  incipient  structures:  N-S  to  NNE-SSW  thrusts,  NE-SW  to  ENE-WSW  dextral  shear  zones,  E-W  normal  faults  and  WNW-ESE  sinistral  shear  zones. These  structures  may  represent  the  local  expression of more fundamental and deeper structures that control the location of the Siguiri  district within the Siguiri Basin. Based on finite strain and conjugate vein analysis, the veining and gold mineralization  are interpreted to have culminated late during the D3S progressive deformation event, as the  local stress-field was switching in response to the waning of the regional maximum stress. The  stress-switches  documented  in  this  study  have  been  widely  recognized  to  happen  at  2070- 2080 Ma across the whole West African Craton and are not restricted to the study area. || The  location  of  the  Siguiri  district,  previously  hosted  amidst  an  undifferentiated  package  of  sediments,  now  falls  at  the  intersection  between  early  WNW-ESE  and  N-S  faults  highlighted  by  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  and  also  recognized  in  geophysics  by Markov  et  al. (this volume). These fundamental structures also intersect with the locations of other smaller  deposits hosted in and around the Siguiri Basin (e.g. Léro, Jean et Gobelé, Kalana). We propose  that the WNW-ESE, N-S and NE-SW faults defining the early architecture of the Siguiri Basin,  applied  a  first-order  structural  control  on  the  location  of  gold  mineralization  in  the  Basin  as  well as magmatic intrusions (Figure 3B) and regional magnetite alteration (Figure 10). Overall, the link between basin morphology and the later orogenic gold mineralisation  is a major exploration targeting tool for orogenic gold systems. || The  results  of  this  study  allow  to:  1)  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  fundamental  lithofacies  and  architecture  of  the  Siguiri  Basin,  and  its  tectonic  position  in  the  West  African  Craton  evolution,  2)  explain  that  the  location  of  the  world-class orogenic gold Siguiri district is controlled by the early architecture of the Basin, and  3)  provide  a  fundamental  targeting  criteria  for  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West  African  Craton. Geological context  Regional Geology  The Siguiri Basin is located in the north-western part of the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé- Mossi  domain,  which  covers  western  Guinea,  southern  Mali,  most  of  Burkina  Faso,  western  Niger,  south-east  Liberia,  Ivory  Coast  and  western  Ghana;  the  Kédougou-Kéniéba  inlier,  in  eastern Senegal, being the western-most expression of these Birimian terranes (ca. 2050-2200  Ma; Figure 3A). The Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain was accreted against the Archean  54 || The  stacked  conglomerates  sitting  near  its  base  are  interpreted  as  the  products  of  subaqueous,  cohesive  debris  flows  (Mulder  and  Alexander,  2001). They incorporated relatively local clasts, as highlighted by the clast angularity, sorting  and the along-strike variations in their origin. This is exemplified by the shale-dominated clasts  eroded along the marine (or lake) slope  from the older Balato and Fatoya Formations in the  Siguiri  district  while  limestone  clasts  dominates  in the  conglomerates  observed  closer to  the  Marble Hill location. The rest of the Kintinian is interpreted as a return to a low energy marine  or lake depositional setting with fluctuating water geochemistry and conditions at the origin of  the organic-rich shales / limestone interbeds (Figure 6F). Overall,  the  Siguiri  district  sediments  are  interpreted  as  marine  or  lake  sedimentary  deposits. They  initially  form  a  regressive  (coarsening-upward)  sequence  showing  a  transition  from (Figure 9):   1) low-energy marine (or lake) organic-rich shales (lower Balato Formation);   2) onset of gravity-flow deposits and distal turbidite deposition (possibly turbidite lobe  complex including distributary channel fills), and;   81 || The Kintinian Formation – a Tarkwa Group sequence? With  the  sole  base  of  the  geochronological  record  it  remains  difficult  to  determine  wether the Siguiri district sediments  belong to the Upper Birimian or Tarka Group. The first  detailed  study  of  the  Tarkwaian  sedimentary  rocks  lithotype  in  Ghana,  defining  the  Tarkwa  Group,  was  conducted  over  40  years  ago  by  Sestini  (1973). The  Tarkwaian  consists  of  intercalations  of  conglomerates,  sandstones  and  phyllites. The  conglomeratic  layers  display  Birimian quartz pebbles and volcanic clasts and were interpreted to represent piedmont-type  deposits (short transport in an environment of active continental erosion; Bossière et al., 1996;  Mueller et al., 1996), similar to that found on the southern foot of the Alps and the Himalayas  (Hirdes  and  Nunoo,  1994;  Sestini,  1973). Since  this  early  work,  sedimentary  rocks  from  the  Tarkwa Group have been described in other parts of the West African Craton. || The Siguiri Basin, has been known for its gold endowment since the 12th century and  potentially  as  early  as  the  3rd  century,  and  is  associated  with  a  prolonged  and  ongoing  artisanal  mining  history  (Watts,  2010). Over  the  last  84  years,  gold  in  the  Basin  has  been  produced  at  an  industrial  scale  by  various  international  mining  companies  including  by  a  French company starting the production in 1931, a Russian company from 1960 to 1963, and  North  American  and  British  companies  in  the  1980s. In  2002,  the  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district was bought by AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (Watts, 2010). Gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district have been discussed by a MSc student (Steyn, 2012) and contractors, but descriptions  and interpretations  differ greatly. For instance, typology of gold mineralisation in the  district  has  been  ascribed  to  a  variety  of  styles  ranging  from  epithermal  lode  (Paranhos,  2008),  orogenic  (Holcombe,  2007)  to  paleoplacers  overprinted  by  mineralised  veins  (Watts,  2010). || The Siguiri district geochronology in the West African context  Geochronological  constraints  on  sedimentary  rocks  are  typically  limited  by  the  mechanisms that generate them, including erosion, transport and deposition. Zircons analysed  in  this  study  can  be  zoned  and  have  a  variety  of  origins  (igneous,  metamorphic  or  hydrothermal). The  age  obtained  from  these  zircons  can  therefore  reflect  the  age  of  crystallisation of a magma, the age of a metamorphism or that of an hydrothermal event. The  prismatic habit and strong oscillatory zoning displayed by the vast majority of zircons analysed  in  this  study  is  suggestive  of  magmatic  zircons. The  ages  considered  in  this  study  are  crystallisation  ages  of  eroded  or  deposited  igneous  rocks  and  may  thus  represent  maximum  depositional ages only. The fact that all five detrital samples display a polymodal distribution of  detrital zircon ages, reflects the existence of multiple sources or of a polymict source. || The V3A vein set also represents the first episode of gold mineralisation recognized  in the Siguiri district. Gold was found locked in the V3A pyrite crystal lattice (up to 43.3 ppm Au;  Figure 45; Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). The third hydrothermal event also occurred late during D3S, and developed along the  ten to fifteen metre-thick sub-vertical damage zones formed early during D3S deformation. This  event  is  mainly  characterised  by  intense  V3B  quartz-ankerite-arsenopyrite  veining  and  is  ubiquitous in the Siguiri district. The  conjugate V3B  veins moderately to steeply dip to the SE  and  are  associated  with  minor  albite  and  pyrite. This  vein-hosted  mineralisation  is  also  characterized by minor sericitisation and carbonate alteration mainly expressed as millimetre- sized siderite nodules. || The basal Kintinian olistostrome marks the interface between the Fatoya and Kintinian  Formations and can be traced in regional magnetic datasets and by field mapping as a narrow  N-S belt across the entire Siguiri Basin (Figure 10). The prominence of this N-S trend in other  major volcano-sedimentary belts across the West African Craton, parallel to the central Siguiri  Basin (e.g. Yanfolila Belt; Figure 3A), indicates probable basement structure reactivation. Bends  in  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  and  in  the  rest  of  the  lithostratigraphy  defined  in  the  Siguiri  district  can  be  observed  both  at  the  scale  of  the  district  (Figure  5)  and  at  the  regional  scale  where  the  olistostrome  forms  a  “Z”-shaped  unit  recognized  across  the  entire  Siguiri  Basin  (Figure  3B  and  10). The  peculiar  shape  of  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  recognized  across  the  Siguiri Basin originated from the first phases of orogenic contraction affecting the Basin, such  as  D1S  N-S  compression. The  WNW-ESE,  N-S  and  NE-SW  structures  that  bound  the  Kintinian  olistostrome  across  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Figure  3B,  5  and  10)  are  therefore  considered  to  represent  fundamental  deeper  basement  structures  that  controlled  the  thickness  and  morphology of this unit at the time of its deposition. || The deformation events and structural features identified in the Siguiri district can be  correlated with the ones described by Milési et al. (1989, 1992), Miller et al. (2013) and Steyn  (2012). This correlation is summarized in Figure  25 and indicates that D1S correlates with the  D1 N-S compressional event recognized by Milési et al. (1989, 1992), Miller et al. (2013) and  possibly  Steyn  (2012). || The disseminated mineralization, specific to the Sanu Tinti deposit (Sanu Tinti style of  gold  mineralization;  Figure  28F  to  28H),  is  focused  in  porous  conglomeratic  beds  and  characterized by corroded and fractured pyrite with gold, chalcopyrite, galena fracture infills. The  timing  of the  Sanu  Tinti  style  of mineralization is  constrained  between the  formation of  the overprinting S4S cleavage and the timing of the thrust fault along which the disseminated  pyrite has developed (this fault is reactivated in early-D3S, but most likely have formed during  D2S). The vein hosted gold mineralization texture (Kosise style of mineralization) forms the  bulk of the  gold endowment  in the Siguiri district, and contrasts with the  disseminated style  observed  in  Sanu  Tinti  (Figure  28A  to  28F  and  28I  to  28K). This  style  of  mineralization  is  associated with the V3A and V3B vein sets. The V3A veins typically contain abundant free gold in  pyrite  fractures. These  veins  are  associated  with  localized  carbonate  alteration  of  the  host  rock,  developing millimeter-sized  siderite  nodules  within  the  first  few centimeters  to meters  around them. || The maximum ages of deposition for the Siguiri district sediments are all within error  of  each  other  and  average  at  ca. 2117  Ma  (Figure  14). Currently,  the  only  constraint  on  the  minimum deposition age  is provided by the crystallisation age of the  Saraya volcanic breccia  (2092±5  Ma),  sitting  on  top  of  the  siliciclastic  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Siguiri  district. This  volcanic unit is coeval with the intrusion of the Maléa monzogranite, whose crystallisation age  was dated by Parra-Avila et al. (this volume) at 2089±12 Ma. Based  on  a  recent  regional  synthesis  Davis  et  al. || These  structures,  which  cut  across  F2S  folds  (Figure  28D  and  28E),  are  expressed  differently  across  the  Siguiri  district. Most  of  these  are  incipient  faults,  and  expressed  as  damage  zones  around  incipient  structures such as in Kosise (Figure 28D), delineated by zones of dense veining (Figure 28C and  28F). These damage zones are cryptic and therefore difficult to recognize on the field and in  geophysics  but  based  on  their  regular  orientation,  could  be  linked  to  fundamental  deeper  137 || These  transient  events  of  stress-switch  were  interpreted  in  the  Siguiri  district  to  be  linked  to  the  reduction  of  the  deviatoric  stress  tensor  and  require  a  major  reduction  of  differential  stress  (early-D3S  and  syn-V3B/late-D3S  143 || These  veins  commonly  display  crack-seal  textures  typical  of  gold  bearing  veins  in  orogenic-type  deposits  and  consistent  with  fault-valve  pulsative  behaviour  (Sibson et al., 1988; Sibson et al., 1998). The steep orientation is the most prominent vein set  developed in Siguiri and was also observed and mined by artisanal miners within and outside  of  the  Siguiri  district. Higher  densities  of  these  veins  develop  around  all  four  orientations  of  discrete  and  incipient  faults  described  in  the  previous  sections  and  represent  the  main  ore  shoots in the district (Figure 24A, 24B and 28C and 28F). Conjugate analyses on the V3B veins,  together  with  the  fault  pattern  geometry  mapped  in  the  pits,  indicates  that  the  stress-field  133 || This  comparison  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation in the Siguiri district is coeval with gold events in numerous other orogenic gold  deposits from the West African Craton but that a latter timing of gold mineralisation can also  be recognized across the Craton. This study hence suggests that latter gold mineralisation than  that recognized in the Siguiri district could be found elsewhere in the Siguiri Basin. 156 || This is the only  place  in  the  Siguiri  district  where  in  situ  beds  of  meta-limestone  were  observed. The  conglomerate  layers  found  in  the  Marble  Hill  are  similar  to  the  ones  hosted  in  the  Kintinian  Formation and observed in the Sanu Tinti deposit. However, in the conglomerate units in and  around the Marble Hill, limestone clasts increase in proportion (drill-hole SIDD002; Figure 5A). The Marble Hill conglomerates are viewed as a locally sourced lateral variation of the Kintinian  conglomerate  found  in  the  Sanu  Tinti  deposit. The  meta-limestone  beds  are  therefore  considered to represent the overturned stratigraphic top of the Fatoya Formation or base of  the Kintinian Formation (Figure 9). Even though not enough zircons could be separated from  the  meta-limestone,  meta-greywacke  from  the  top  of  the  Marble  Hill  were  sampled  successfully for SHRIMP dating (sample Si241; Figure 5A). || Thus,  it  is  proposed  that  the  gold events  in  Siguiri  (syn-D3S  and  syn-D4S)  occurred  during  the  ca. 2102-2085  Ma  episode  of  gold  mineralisation  recognized across the West African Craton. These conclusions have a direct impact on orogenic  gold  exploration  since  these  suggest  that  younger  economic  gold  mineralisation  coeval  with  the  second  episode  of  magmatism  at  ca. 2085-2054  Ma,  such  as  the  late  gold  overprint  in  Morila, could be found in the Siguiri Basin. Conclusion  The Siguiri district, hosted in the weakly metamorphosed sediments of the Siguiri Basin  (Guinea)  is  characterized  by  a  polyphase  hydrothermal  history  and  two  textures  of  the  hydrothermal mineral assemblages. The dominant texture, or Kosise style, displays vein haloes  structurally  controlled  by  early-D3S  N-S,  NE-SW,  WNW-ESE  and  E-W  damage  zones. || Whole-rock major and trace element geochemical analyses  Whole-rock  major  and  trace  element  compositions  were  measured  on  each  sample  collected  from  Bidini,  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1. The  aim  was  to  identify  1)  the  different  geochemical  variations  associated  with  mineralisation  between  the  three  sedimentary  formations hosting the Siguiri district, and; 2) the main geochemical differences between these  formations. Geochemical analyses (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices) were carried out by Intertek  Genalysis Laboratories in Perth, using a combination of analytical techniques detailed in Table  6 in Electronic Appendices. The Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Bunbury basalt  and Kerba granite standards were included to monitor instrument precision. Data precision for  both  standards  was  typically  within  3%  for  major  elements  and  10%  for  trace  elements. Detection  limits  for  each  element  are  provided  in  Table  6  in  Electronic  Appendices. || Whole-rock multi-element geochemistry  Baseline geochemistry  Comparison of the baseline geochemistry for the least altered samples of all three rock  types  (conglomerate,  shale  and  greywacke)  from  each  three  formations  hosting  the  Siguiri  district indicates that most elements have similar concentrations in all rock types of all three  formations (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). However, when data from the Kintinian, Fatoya  and  Balato  Formations  are  normalised  to  a  sample  representative  of  the  dominant  lithology  found  in  the  Siguiri  district  (least  altered  greywacke  from  Kosise  in  the  Fatoya  Formation),  variations  in  a  suite  of  elements  can  be  observed  (Figure  42A). The  baseline  geochemical  variations between the three formations are also observed when comparing the geochemistry  of all collected samples (least altered and altered; Figure 43). In  particular,  baseline  geochemistry  of  the  Kintinian  Formation  is  associated  with  increased concentrations of Ca, F, Li, Mg, Ni, Sc, Sn, Sr, U, V (+ minor increases in Ga and W)  and decreased concentrations of As, Cu, Pr, Si and Zr when compared to the Fatoya and Balato  Formations (Figure 43; Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Baseline geochemistry of the Balato  Formation,  when  compared  to  those  for  the  Kintinian  and  Fatoya  Formations,  is  associated  with a marked increase in Ba, minor increases in concentration of Bi, Cu, Hf, Pr, Sr, Th, Zn, Zr  and  a  minor  decrease  in  Ge  (Figure  43;  Table  3  in  Electronic  Appendices). These  variations  shows  that  the  Balato  Formation  differs  geochemically  mainly  from  the  Kintinian  Formation  (Figure  42A  and  43). || are  consistently  oriented  NE-SW  across  the  entire  Siguiri  district  and  are  typically  steeply  dipping  to  the  SE. Overprinting  all  earlier  structures,  the  D4S  NW-SE  compression  develops a  penetrative steep cleavage, S4S, that is parallel to the sub-solidus magmatic fabric found in the  Maléa monzogranite which intrudes the Siguiri Basin sediments a few kilometres north of the  Siguiri district (Figure 2B). Methodology  Fieldwork and sample selection  Twenty-two  weeks  of  fieldwork  in  the  Siguiri  Basin  were  conducted  over  2  years  starting  in  April  2011. Fieldwork  campaigns,  of  about  a  month  length  each,  were  mainly  focused  on  the  Siguiri  district  tenement  (Figure  5),  with  2  weeks  of  regional  field  transects  undertaken. Observations  and  description  of  the  stratigraphy,  lithofacies  associations  and  geochronological  sampling  were  conducted  directly  on  outcrop  and  drill  core.

The  present  dataset  do  not  allow  to  conclude  in  regards  to  D4S  gold  occurrence  and  further  work  would  be  required  to  assess  whether  gold  remobilisation  occurred or not. Geochemical footprint of the ore shoots  The  alteration  associated  with  the  superimposition  of  all  four  hydrothermal  events  was  geochemically  characterised  across  the  Siguiri  district  (Figure  42,  43  and  44). In  the  different  deposits  and  in  the  representative  Kosise  deposit  in  particular,  the  geochemical  variations associated with this style of mineralisation are characterised by enrichments in Ag,  Au, As, Bi, S, Sb, Te and W within the first fifteen meters around the ore shoots at minimum  (Figure 44). These enrichments relative to the geochemical baseline of the hosting formation,  are characteristic of hypozonal to mesozonal orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998; Eilu  et al., 1999; Groves et al., 2003) and are accompanied, in Siguiri, by additional increases in Co,  Mo, Na/Al (molar), Se and decreases in Ca, Cs, F, Ga, Hf, 3K/Al (molar), Li, Mg, P and V across  the  main  ore  shoot. These  variations  can  be  directly  related  to  the  hydrothermal  mineral  assemblage associated with the V3A and V3B gold mineralisation event. || controlling  the morphology  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. These  fundamental  structures are  viewed  as  the  first  order  structures  controlling  the  location  of  the  world-class  Siguiri  district  in  the  eponym Basin. District  to  deposit  scale  structural  work  indicates  that  the  Siguiri  district  underwent  four  deformation  events:  a  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  progressively  evolving into a transpression and later on into a transtension (early- and late-D3S respectively),  and a NW-SE compression (D4S). While D1S deformation is cryptic and commonly expressed as  F1S  recumbent  folds  with  E-W  to  NW-SE  and  NE-SW  striking  axial  traces,  D2S  is  typically  characterised by F2S upright folds with NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE striking axial planes that refolds  F1S folds and are responsible for the bulk of the deformation and structural grain observed in  the Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin. The F2S folds are overprinted by four main orientations of  structures that develop (or are reactivated) during the early stages of D3S deformation and are  consistent with a transpressional deformation: N-S thrusts, E-W normal faults, NE-SW dextral  shear  zones  and  WNW-ESE  sinistral  shear  zones. In  field  exposures  and  in  drill  core,  these  structures are typically discreet and only expressed as sub-vertical damage zones ten to fifteen  meters wide and characterised by an increase  in  vein  density or  by  disseminated pyrite. || controls  on  auriferous  quartz  veining  in  8  of  the  deposits  of  the  district. Based  on  bedding- fabric-vein-fault  relationships,  Steyn  (2012)  identified  3  deformation  events  in  the  Siguiri  district: D1, D2 and D3. One  gold event was recognized in the district and is associated with  steeply  dipping  syn-D2  quartz-carbonate-sulfide  veins  striking  to  the  N-S  to  NE-SW  and  commonly  displaying  conjugate  relationships. These  veins  are  accompanied  by  carbonate  alteration in the  form of millimeter-sized nodules overgrowing the  quartz-albite-sericite host  rock mineralogy. Based on bedding-fabric-vein-fault relationships, Steyn (2012) concluded that  auriferous veining in the Siguiri district is dominantly controlled by competent lithologies, N-S  to NW-SE F2 fold hinges and N-S to NE-SW shear zones developed during D2 in an ENE-WSW  dextral transpressive environment. The Siguiri region has been long recognized for its endowment and has been producing  gold  for  centuries. || develops  progressively  from  D2S  compression  into  an  early-D3S  E-W  to  ENE-WSW  directed  transpression and a late-D3S NNW-SSE directed transtension characterized by the development  of the bulk of the veining observed in the Siguiri district. The fourth and last event (D4S) was a  NW-SE oriented compressional event responsible for the localized overprinting of veining by a  steep to shallowly dipping NNE-SSW ductile cleavage. Gold  mineralization  formed  along  sub-vertical  early-D3S  N-S  thrusts,  NE-trending  dextral  shear  zones,  WNW-trending  sinistral  faults  and  E-trending  normal  relay  faults. Mineralization is expressed as localized mineralized shear zones or sub-vertical damage zones,  characterized  by  a  10-15  metre-wide  zone  of  dense  quartz-carbonate-sulfide  veining  or  disseminated  gold-bearing  sulfides. The  mineralized  veins  consistently  strikes  to  the  ENE- WSW, are steeply dipping, and commonly have a conjugate geometry at the meso-scale. Finite  strain analysis on folds, faults and conjugate mineralized vein sets is consistent with an initial  stress-switch  from  a  compressional  (D2S)  to  transpressional  deformation  (termed  early-D3S). || field  observations  and  geochemistry  appeared  to  be  the  most  important  tools  to  target  ore  shoots in the Siguiri district. However,  several  key  questions  remain  to  be  answered. Even  though  a  model  is  proposed,  further  work  would  be  required  to  fully  assess  how  the  Siguiri  Basin  opened  and  how was the extension oriented. Multiple deformation events and cleavages were observed in  the Siguiri district and even though the main events and most visible cleavages are now well  constrained,  further  work  would  be  required  to  assess  the  importance  of  the  D1S  N-S  compression in the Siguiri Basin and the development of its associated cleavage. The number  of fluids responsible for the four hydrothermal events observed in the Siguiri district and their  respective composition could not be constrained in this thesis but could be constrained by a  fluid inclusion and stable isotope study. These studies could potentially also give an answer as  to  where  the  fluid(s)  and  the  gold  originated  from,  even  though  this  question  has  been  the  subject of a still ongoing debate in the literature. || from V2S, V3A, V3B veins and syn-D4S all came from the Fatoya and Kintinian Formations (Kosise  and Bidini deposits). Small amounts of pyrite were found in the Balato Formation (Sintroko PB1  deposit) and could not be linked to any of the four generations. Samples of arsenopyrite came  from  the  Balato  and  Fatoya  Formations  (Sintroko  PB1  and  Bidini  deposits). Samples  were  separated according to the nature of their host rock (either greywacke, shale or conglomerate;  Table  5  in  Electronic  Appendices). Laser  ablation  was  used  to  provide  the  missing  links  between  the  different  textures  of  the  hydrothermal  mineral  assemblages  observed  in  the  Siguiri  district. In  particular,  laser  ablation  and  EPMA  data  allowed  the  comparison  of  the  major  and  trace  element  signatures  from  the  multiple  pyrite  generations  from  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1  and  the  pyrite  found  in  the  Bidini  conglomerate. || geochronology  of  the  central  Siguiri  Basin  rocks.

This  deformation  event  progressively  evolved  to  an  early-D3S  transpression,  characterized  by  the  reactivation  of  the  N-S  and  E-W  faults,  and  the  development  of NE-SW dextral and WNW-ESE sinistral shear zones  (Figure  33). In  the Siguiri  district,  these  structures  are  typically  expressed  as  sub-vertical  incipient  structures,  represented  by  discreet  damage  zones  associated  with  a  ten-fifteen  meters  wide  halo  of  increased vein density, developed during the late-D3S NNW-SSE transtensional event (Lebrun et  al., in review 2015a; Chapter 3). All structural elements in the Siguiri district were overprinted  during the youngest deformation event, D4S, which is characterized by local F4S folds with sub- horizontal NE-SW trending fold axes, affecting late-D3S structures. The D4S event is associated  with  a  penetrative  sub-vertical  NNE-SSW  S4S  cleavage,  axial  planar  to  the  F4S  folds  at  the  outcrop  scale.

Structural framework  A protracted deformation history for the Siguiri Basin has been recently compiled on  the  basis  of  the  Siguiri  district  study  (Steyn,  2012;  Lebrun  et  al.,  in  review  2015;  Chapter  3). This  deformation  history  is  characterized  by  three  folding  episodes  associated  with:  a  N-S  compression,  D1S,  followed  by  an  E-W  compression,  D2S  (that  progressively  evolved  into  a  transpression and then a transtension during D3S), and a late NW-SE compression, D4S (Figure  4).

HYDROTHERMAL ACTIVITY, MINERALISATION AND GEOCHEMISTRY    Hydrothermal  activity  in  the  Siguiri  district  was  found  to  be  polyphase  and  characterised  by  four  distinct  events,  taking  place  during  D2S,  D3S  and  D4S  deformations.   The  first three  hydrothermal events  are mainly  associated with the development  of three generations of veins (V2S, V3A and V3B) whereas the last event (syn-D4S) is  characterised  by  pervasive  hydrothermal  activity  associated  with  a  penetrative  cleavage (S4S).   LA-ICP-MS  was  used  to  compare  the  different  trace  element  signatures  of  the  sulphides  associated with these hydrothermal events and constrain their relative  timing. || lake sediments, while the Fatoya Formation consists of distal turbidite deposits (thin-bedded  turbidites  and  channel-fill  deposits). Altogether  they  form  a  basal  regressive  sequence. The  over-lying  Kintinian  Formation  is  shale-rich,  and  displays  up  to  a  100  metre-thick  stack  of  polymict  conglomeratic  interbeds  observed  in  the  basal  part  of  the  Formation  in  the  Siguiri  district. These  conglomerates  transect  the  whole  Siguiri  Basin  and  are  interpreted  as  the  product  of  repeated  subaqueous  debris  flow  deposits  and  to  represent  olistostromes  (or  mélanges  of  sedimentary  origin)  with  various  autochthonous  and  allochthonous  clasts. The  Balato,  Fatoya  and  Kintinian  Formations  maximum  age  of  deposition  was  dated  at  2113±10,  2113±5 Ma and 2124±7 Ma respectively. The minimum age of deposition of these sediments is  constrained  by  a  crosscutting  volcanic  breccia  dated  at  2092±5  Ma,  and  by  the  Maléa  monzogranite  intrusion  dated  at  2089±12  Ma. || largest  city  in  Guinea.

Due to its very poor outcropping quality, the lithostratigraphy of the Siguiri Basin has  received  little  attention,  and  existing  studies  have  mostly  focused  on  the  importance  of  magmatism during the Eburnean orogeny (Egal et al., 2002). Early regional mapping from the  French Geological Survey (BRGM) described the Siguiri Basin  as an homogeneous package of  undifferentiated fine sedimentary rocks (Egal et al., 1999; Feybesse et al., 1999). This  paper  presents  a  multi-disciplinary  study  combining  sedimentological,  geochronological  and  geophysical  analyses  over  the  Siguiri  district  that  allows  for  further  discrimination of the Siguiri Basin sedimentary record. Used collectively, the datasets constrain  the lithostratigraphic succession of the central Siguiri Basin and permit the drafting of a new  geological  map  for  this  critical  region. || lattice  of  the  V3B  arsenopyrite  have  similar  Ag/Au  and  Ni/Co  ratios  to  all  pyrite  generations,  around 7.5 and 2.81 respectively (Figure 45E and 45I). In summary, while no arsenopyrite was  found in the Kintinian Formation, arsenopyrite from the Balato Formation shows enrichment in  Ag, Co, Cr, Cu, Sb, Ti (and minor Mn) and depletion in As when compared to the arsenopyrite  hosted in the Fatoya Formation (Table 5 in Electronic Appendices). Discussion  Polyphase hydrothermal activity and gold mineralisation  Field  observations  of  vein  cross-cutting  relationships,  core  logging  and  petrographic  descriptions from Bidini, Sintroko PB1 and Kosise, permit the construction of local paragenetic  sequences  for  each  individual  deposit  studied. When  compared  to  one  another,  the  local  paragenetic  sequences  are  homogeneous  across  the  Siguiri  district  and  are  characterised  by  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. These  events  were  correlated  in  the  district-scale  paragenetic sequence (Figure 46) summarized below. Together, the laser ablation data (Figure  45) and the general paragenetic  sequence of the district,  reflects  the polyphase  character of  gold mineralisation in Siguiri and three distinct gold mineralisation events were identified. || observed interbeded within the Formation (Figure 6E and 7D). These conglomerates consist of  dominantly  clast-supported  deposits  with  5  to  30  vol%  of  fine-grained  (mudstone  to  fine  greywacke)  matrix  (Figure  6E). The  clasts  are  angular  to  sub-rounded  and  poorly  sorted,  ranging in size from a few millimetres up to a meter but average 2-3 centimetres (Figure 7D). Based  on  field  and  core  observations,  thin-sections  and  photographs,  clast  lithologies  in  the  Siguiri district include:   -  shale. These  commonly  massive  clasts  sometimes  show  fine  laminations  or  are  interbedded with siltstone and greywacke. They are dark grey to light brown when not  altered, and represent about 85 vol% of the clasts observed;   -  limestone. || orogenesis,  somewhere  around  2070-2080  Ma  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013b),  referred  to  as  the  “late-orogenic”  phase  by  Milési  et  al.

This  timing  suggests  that  the  stress-switches  responsible  for  gold  mineralization  in  the  Siguiri  district,  occurring  between  the  early-D3S  transpression  and  the  syn-V3B  (late-D3S)  transtension,  have  been  caused  by  a  regional  mechanism. Such  a  regional  mechanism  may  have  been  driven  either  by  far-field  stress  variations or body forces. Variations in the regional far-field stress, as documented in Allibone  et al.

Therefore,  the  Siguiri  district  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  characterise the alteration haloes associated with gold mineralisation found in the Basin. Laser  ablation  data  are  used  to  constrain  the  relative  timing  of  the  different  generations  of  pyrite  observed,  allowing  the  creation  of  a  district-scale  paragenetic  sequence,  which  serves  to  highlight  the  polyphase  nature  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district. Comparison  between  the  timing  of  the  main  gold  mineralisation  event  in  the  district  with  events  from  other orogenic gold systems of the West African Craton can elucidate the temporal patterns of  mineralisation on the regional scale, with implications for prospectivity.

However, available data show that the Kintinian conglomerates occur as thick  (~10-15 m) deposits overlain by thin (<50 cm) shale to mudstone intervals. The conglomerates  were observed at  the contact  with Fatoya greywackes, above  a thrust  fault in the  Sanu Tinti  deposit, and reworking meta-limestone/marble in drill cores from the Silakoro area. Based on  the  current  data,  the  conglomeratic  layers  sit  near  the  base  of  the  Kintinian  Formation,  are  overlain  by  mudstone  and  boudinaged  limestone  interbeds  representing  the  bulk  of  the  Kintinian Formation (Figure 6F), and their true thickness varies across the map and in cores. In  order  to  integrate  the  observations  from  the  Siguiri  district  in  the  broader  Siguiri  basin  framework,  two  additional  localities  were  investigated: the  Marble  Hill  and  the  Saraya  area  (Figure  3B  and  5A).

Since  AngloGold Ashanti took over  the  operations,  production  at  the  Siguiri  district  has  been  approximately  10  t/year  for  an  estimated  cumulative  production  of  105.5  t  Au  in  2014  (Table  2  in  Electronic  Appendices;  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., n.d.). Therefore, the cumulative production from the Siguiri district is  ca. 160 t Au (5.3 Moz), with resources of ca 80 t Au (2.6 Moz), making the district world class  according  to  the  classification  of  Schodde  and  Hronsky  (2006).

The relatively fine-grained, thin-bedded turbidites suggest a rather distal depositional setting,  such  as  the  outer  part  of  a  channel-levee  system  (Piper  and  Deptuck,  1997)  and/or  a  distal  turbidite lobe setting (e.g. Gervais et al., 2006; Bourget et al., 2010). In contrast, the presence  of  thick  beds  (up  to  ~5  m-thick)  of  massive  medium  to  fine-grained  greywacke  in  drill  cores  suggest  deposition  in  a  low-relief,  channelized  depositional  environment  such  as  lobe  distributaries  (Gervais  et  al.,  2006;  Bourget  et  al.,  2010). The  meta-limestone/marbles,  reworked  by  the  Kintinian  conglomerates,  are  interpreted  to  lay  at  the  top  of  the  Fatoya  Formation or base of the Kintinian Formation.

In  these  veins,  LA-ICP-MS  data  shows  that  gold  is  locked  in  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice. The second and main episode of mineralisation also occurs late during D3S deformation  and is associated with the later quartz-ankerite-arsenopyrite-(pyrite) veins, which crosscut the  early  ankerite-pyrite  veins  and  are  coeval  with  pyrite  dissemination  in  conglomerate  layers. Gold is either found native in the veins or invisible and locked in the vein-hosted arsenopyrite  crystal  lattice. The  last  gold  event  is  associated  with  the  D4S  deformation,  which  fractures  previously  developed  sulphides  and  precipitate  free  gold  in  their  fractures. The  geochemical  footprint  of  gold mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  was  recognised  to  be  associated  with a  wide halo of at least fifteen meters, enriched in: Ag, Au, As, Bi, Co, LOI, Mo, Sb, Se, SO3, Te and  W, typical of orogenic gold mineralisation. ||   Geochemical  variations  across  the  ore  shoots  of  the  Siguiri  district  show  enrichments in: Ag, Au, As, Bi, Co, Mo, Sb, Se, SO3, Te and W. CaO was found to  mark  the  reaction  front  of  the  mineralising  fluids  and  3K/Al  and  Na/Al  modal  saturation indices were found to highlight the discreet ore shoots over distance up  to 10 to 15 meters.   Comparison  between  the  timing  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  other  gold  deposits  in  the  West  African  Craton,  indicates  that  syn-D3S  gold  is  uncommon  in  the  rest  of  the  Craton  whereas  economic  syn-D4S  gold  could  be  found in the Siguiri Basin. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE WORK  In  terms  of  academic  research,  this  work  improves  the  understanding  of  the  Siguiri  Basin formation and of its tectono-stratigraphic position in the evolution of the West African  Craton  throughout  the  Eburnean  orogeny. This  work  identifies  the  fundamental  structures  which  control  the  morphology  of  the  Basin,  the  main  lithostratigraphic  Formations  exposed  and  gives  an  interpretation  of  their  environment  of  formation. In  addition,  this  work  also  introduces the concept of stress-switch as a critical process and a pre-requisite (or cause) for  orogenic gold mineralisation rather than as a passive effect of the fault-valve process. ||   However, comparison of the lithostratigraphy and geochronology of the Kintinian  Formation with the rest of the West African Craton suggests that this Formation is  part of the Lower Tarkwa Group, typically described as "late orogenic basin"-type  sediments.   The  Kintinian  stacks  of  polymict  conglomerate  were  interpreted  to  represent  an  olistostrome and can be followed throughout the whole Siguiri Basin.   The  deposition  of  this  olistostrome  is  interpreted  to  mark  a  change  in  the  dynamics of the Siguiri Basin opening, and the onset of increased tectonic activity  associated with the first phases of Eburnean compression.   The peculiar shape of the Kintinian olistostrome highlights the early architecture of  the Siguiri Basin and is controlled by N-S, NE-SW and WNW-ESE faults presumed to  represent fundamental structures that controlled the location of the Siguiri district  in the Basin. 215 ||   The early-D3S deformation is responsible for the development (or reactivation) of  N-S thrusts, E-W normal faults, NE-SW dextral shear zones and WNW-ESE sinistral  shear zones.   The  N-S,  E-W,  NE-SW  and WNW-ESE  structures  control  the  development of  late- D3S veining (V3S) and the location of ore shoots across the Siguiri district.   The  D4S  deformation  event  overprinted  all  previously  developed  structural  features,  locally  refolds  V3S  veins  and  develops  a  sub-vertical  NE-SW  striking  S4S  cleavage.   The  mineralised  structures  are  often  found  to  be  discreet  incipient  structures  developed  as  ten  to  fifteen  meters  wide  sub-vertical  areas  of  dense  V3S  veining,  216<br><b>Geocode:</b> Siguiri, Siguiri Prefecture, Kankan Region, Guinea<br><b>Pages:</b> 109,111,113,114,115,116,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,140,143,144,145,146,148,150,152,155,156,158,16,164,169,171,172,178,179,180,182,184,186,187,191,197,198,200,201,202,203,32,33,34,35,38,40,41,43,45,46,48,49,5,51,52,53,55,56,6,60,61,62,63,64,7,74,75,77,78,79,80,82,84,86,87,88,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,99<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  study  is  based  on  field  observations, geophysical datasets, drill core logging and petrographic observations. This work  focuses  on  district  and  deposit-scale  observations  of  the  second  and  third  order  structures  controlling  gold  mineralisation. It  describes  the  different  structural  features  encountered  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  the  link  they  have  with  gold  mineralisation. This  paper  discusses  the  deformation  history  of  the  Siguiri  district,  the  development  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  district and the stress-field variations associated with this mineralisation. Based on this work,  four  deformation  events  were  recognized  to  affect  the  Siguiri  district  sediments:  a  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  interpreted  to  progressively  evolve  into  transpression and then transtension (D3S), and a NW-SE compression (D4S). || Even  though  all  these  studies  propose  that  gold  mineralisation  in  Siguiri  is  dominantly  controlled by veins, no consensus was reached by the authors on what controls the location of  the Siguiri gold district at the scale of the Siguiri Basin or what controls the extent of the ore  shoots at the district and deposit scales. To  further  the  understanding  of  the  characteristics,  geometry  and  genesis  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district,  a  multi-scale  and  multidisciplinary  approach  was  employed. This  approach  addresses  the  various  scales  at  which  geological  processes  work  in  gold  mineral  systems. Modern  gold  exploration  strategies  increasingly  rely  on  such  an  approach,  involving  integration  of  fieldwork,  geophysics,  and  geochemistry  among  other  techniques, used at different scales (McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; McCuaig et al., 2010; Robert  et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2010; Williams and Currie, 1993; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Blewett  et  al.,  2010;  Goldfarb  et  al.,  2005;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Groves  et  al.,  2000;  Neumayr  et  al.,  2008; Eilu and Groves, 2001; Eilu et al., 1999). At a province scale, numerous studies highlight  the role of early architecture as a primary control on gold mineralisation (Robert et al., 2005;  Miller et al., 2010; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Chapter two). Down one  scale at the  district  level,  secondary  structures  control  and/or  host  gold  mineralisation  (Blewett  et  al.,  2010;  32 || Figure 33: Form line map of the Siguiri gold district and its different deposits. Locations of the logged drill holes and  areas of interest highlighted in red. After Lebrun et al., (in review 2015a); Chapter 3. 164 || Goldfarb et al., 2001; Goldfarb et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2010; Chapter three). Province- and  district-scale controlling structures are typically delineated using geophysical datasets (Blewett  et al., 2010; Chapter two) but can also be exposed by exploration geochemistry, especially at  smaller scale (e.g. deposit scale; Eilu and Groves, 2001; Eilu et al., 1999; Chapter four). The present study thus focuses on the detailed description of the geology and regional  framework  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district. The  results  of  this  study  presents  the  4D  (space-time)  evolution  of  the  Siguiri  district  lithostratigraphic  record,  structural  architecture,  and  mineral  alteration. Collectively,  the  data  recorded  during  the  course  of  this  study  provides  an  insight  into  the  tectonic  context,  genetic  processes  and  the  geochemical  footprint  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district. || Instead  it  is  located  in  the  center  of  a  large  sedimentary basin in the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain of the West African Craton. The Siguiri gold district  currently  consists of eleven accessible deposits, and is the only  large  gold  district  (>  50  t  Au)  in  the  weakly  metamorphosed  rocks  of  the  Siguiri  Basin  (Egal  et  al.,  1999). Previous work on the district have recognized grade trends but have struggled to put  the geology together and highlight the incipient structures that control gold mineralization at a  deposit,  district  and  regional-scale. Most  notably,  a  study  on  the  structural  controls  of  auriferous quartz veining in eight of the deposits of the district was conducted by Steyn (2012). Steyn (2012) concluded that mineralization is hosted by veins, mainly controlled by competent  lithologies  and  associated  with  N-S  to  NW-SE  fold  hinges  and  N-S  to  NE-SW  shear  zones  developed during  ENE-WSW  transpression. This paper  builds onto the observations made  by  Steyn (2012) and describes the different brittle, ductile and brittle-ductile structures observed  in  the  district,  including  the  different  vein  generations  from  five  representative  deposits  including Sanu Tinti, Bidini, Kami, Kosise and Sintroko PB1. || Interpreted  conformable  contacts are symbolized by full black lines, unconformable and unknown contacts by dashed lines.

In  detail,  the  lithostratigraphy  of  the  Siguiri  district  was  divided  into  three  distinct  sedimentary Formations (Figure 9; Watts, 2010). These Formations are, from older to younger:  the  Balato,  Fatoya  and  Kintinian  Formations.

Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || The Siguiri Basin, has been known for its gold endowment since the 12th century and  potentially  as  early  as  the  3rd  century,  and  is  associated  with  a  prolonged  and  ongoing  artisanal  mining  history  (Watts,  2010). Over  the  last  84  years,  gold  in  the  Basin  has  been  produced  at  an  industrial  scale  by  various  international  mining  companies  including  by  a  French company starting the production in 1931, a Russian company from 1960 to 1963, and  North  American  and  British  companies  in  the  1980s. In  2002,  the  world-class  Siguiri  gold  district was bought by AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (Watts, 2010). Gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district have been discussed by a MSc student (Steyn, 2012) and contractors, but descriptions  and interpretations  differ greatly. For instance, typology of gold mineralisation in the  district  has  been  ascribed  to  a  variety  of  styles  ranging  from  epithermal  lode  (Paranhos,  2008),  orogenic  (Holcombe,  2007)  to  paleoplacers  overprinted  by  mineralised  veins  (Watts,  2010). || residuum gold (e.g. Yatela; Hanssen et al., 2004) and placer type deposits (e.g. Tarkwa; Sestini,  1973; Pigois et al., 2003). Amongst this breadth of gold mineral systems, the Siguiri gold district  in north-eastern Guinea is the only large gold deposit (> 50 t Au; AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., 2013)  hosted in the Siguiri Basin (Figure 1B) and one of the largest gold mineral systems in the West  African Craton.

The  district  is  characterized by a protracted deformation history associated with four main deformation events:  D1S  is  a  N-S  compression;  D2S  is  an  E-W  compression  progressively  evolving  into  an  early-D3S  transpression  and  then  into  a  late-D3S  NNW-SSE  transtension,  and  D4S  is  a  NE-SW  compression. Field observations, petrography and chemical analyses applied to three key deposits of the Siguiri  district  (Bidini,  Sintroko  PB1  and  Kosise)  suggest  that  the  hydrothermal  activity  in  the  district  is  polyphase  and  can  be  subdivided  into  four  distinct  hydrothermal  events. The  first  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  barren  bedding-parallel  and  en-echelon  V2S  quartz- dominated-(pyrite) veins. The second hydrothermal event is characterised by the development of  V3A  pyrite-ankerite  veins  late  during  D3S. Laser  ablation  data  show  that  this  vein  set  contains  an  anomalous gold content  of up to 43.3 ppm locked in its pyrite crystal lattice. || and T.

Based on bedding-fabric-vein-fault relationships, Steyn (2012) concluded that  auriferous veining in the Siguiri district is dominantly controlled by competent lithologies, N-S  to NW-SE F2 fold hinges and N-S to NE-SW shear zones developed during D2 in an ENE-WSW  dextral transpressive environment.

Geochemical variations associated with  the ore shoots in the Siguiri district are consistent with petrographic observations and highlight an  albite-carbonate-sulphide-sericite alteration system. The  fourth  and  last  hydrothermal  event  is  associated  with  the  development  of  a  late  penetrative  S4S  cleavage  during  D4S  deformation. This  late  deformation  event  overprints  all  pre- existing hydrothermal events and is associated with the deposition of free gold, chalcopyrite and  galena along fractures in V3A pyrite and V3B pyrite and arsenopyrite. Mineral  and  geochemical  footprint  and  timing  of  the  gold  events  in  the  Siguiri  district,  when  compared  with  other  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton,  highlight  the  synchronicity  of  gold  mineralisation in Siguiri (syn-D3S and syn-D4S events) with other events of gold mineralisation in this  part  of  the  Craton,  such  as  the  early  Au-Sb-Bi-(Te-W)  mineralisation  at  the  Morila  deposit  in  Southeast Mali. Results support the idea that late Eburnean-age gold mineralisation in the Siguiri  district and in the West African Craton as a whole, is polyphase and that economic post-D4S gold  mineralisation could be found in the Siguiri Basin. || M., Mavrogenes, J., Lentz, D., King, K., Allibone, A., and Holcombe, R., 2011,  Geology  and  Intrusion-Related  Affinity  of  the  Morila  Gold  Mine,  Southeast  Mali:  Economic Geology, v. 106, p. 727-750.

Geochemistry  conducted  in  different  deposits  and  a  composite  geochemical  cross- section  across  ore  shoots  reveals  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  is  associated  with host rock enrichments in: Ag, Au, As, Bi, Sb, Te and W, typical of mesozonal to hypozonal  orogenic gold deposits. These enrichments are also accompanied by additional increases in Co,  Mo, Na/Al (molar), Se and S and decreases in Ca, Cs, F, Ga, Hf, 3K/Al (molar), Li, Mg, P and V  across the main ore shoot. These chemical changes can be linked to the paragenetic sequence,  are indicative of an albite-carbonate-sulphide-sericite alteration associated with the ore shoots  and may increase the size of the targets for exploration. Comparison of the syn-D3S and syn-D4S gold mineralisation timing at the Siguiri district  with  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  from  West  Africa  indicates  that  these  gold  mineralisation  events  are  coeval  with  other  gold  events  recognized  Craton-wide  at  ca. 2102-2085  Ma. || CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION  4D EVOLUTION OF THE OROGENIC GOLD DISTRICT OF  SIGUIRI, GUINEA (WEST AFRICA)  PREAMBLE AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS  The West African Craton (WAC) is also known as the Leo-Man Shield. It is made of two  distinct  terranes:  the  Archean  Kénéma-Man  domain  to  the  south-west,  and  the  Paleoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (Figure  1A). The  Archean  domain  is  dominated  by  gneiss  dated  between  ca. 3540  and  2750  Ma  (Kouamelan  et  al.,  1997;  Thiéblemont  et  al.,  2001) while the Paleoproterozoic domain displays an assemblage of volcano-sedimentary belts  and felsic intrusives, ranging in age from ca. 2250 to 2040 Ma (Davis et al., 2015; Parra-Avila,  2015;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2013). A  large  part  of  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  is  overlain  unconformably  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  Basin  (Begg  et  al.,  2009;  Lawrence et al., 2013a; Villeneuve and Cornée, 1994). || CHAPTER 3: PAPER TWO  STRUCTURAL CONTROLS ON THE WORLD-CLASS SIGUIRI  GOLD DISTRICT, SIGUIRI BASIN, GUINEA, WEST AFRICA  The following paper presents the structural framework associated with the Siguiri gold  district  and  its  evolution  through  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  study  is  based  on  field  observations, geophysical datasets, drill core logging and petrographic observations. This work  focuses  on  district  and  deposit-scale  observations  of  the  second  and  third  order  structures  controlling  gold  mineralisation. It  describes  the  different  structural  features  encountered  in  the  Siguiri  district  and  the  link  they  have  with  gold  mineralisation. This  paper  discusses  the  deformation  history  of  the  Siguiri  district,  the  development  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  district and the stress-field variations associated with this mineralisation. Based on this work,  four  deformation  events  were  recognized  to  affect  the  Siguiri  district  sediments:  a  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  interpreted  to  progressively  evolve  into  transpression and then transtension (D3S), and a NW-SE compression (D4S). || CHAPTER 4: PAPER THREE  MINERALISATION FOOTPRINTS AND REGIONAL TIMING  OF THE SIGUIRI OROGENIC GOLD DISTRICT (GUINEA,  WEST AFRICA)  The following paper focuses on deposit to microscopic scale observations and presents  the  petrographic  and  geochemical  characteristics  of  the  Siguiri  district  and  of  its  gold  mineralisation. This study is based on field observations, drill core logging, petrography, geochemistry  and  in situ analyses by LA-ICP-MS of sulphide  minerals acquired  in  three  key deposits of the  Siguiri district. For each deposit, a log, a cross-section and numerous polished thin-sections are  presented. Based  on  this  work,  gold  mineralisation  characteristics  were  found  to  be  consistent  across the different deposits making the Siguiri district. Gold mineralisation in the district was  found to be  polyphase  and  to have  occurred mainly  during D3S,  but  was  interpreted to have  also occurred during D4S deformation. The timing of gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district is  also  constrained  in  this  study  and  compared  with  gold  mineralisation  events  from  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton. || Fougerouse,  D.,  Micklethwaite,  S.,  Halfpenny,  A.,  Kilburn,  M. and  Ulrich,  S.,  2015,  Gold  remobilisation  from  Arsenopyrite:  Crystal-plasticity  and  dissolution-reprecipitation  reactions: Proceeding of the SGA conference 2015  Fougerouse, D., Micklethwaite, S., Ulrich, S., Miller, J., Godel, B., Adams, D.

(1989); Milési et al., (1992). The  location  of  orogenic  gold  deposits  is  typically  controlled  by  complex  regional-scale  fault  networks (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2000). In West Africa, the Ashanti fault system in  Ghana, is one example of such a network, and its many faults host some of the biggest vein- hosted  and  fault-vein-hosted  orogenic  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Obuasi,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002;  Fougerouse  et  al.,  this  volume). The  Siguiri  district  (240  t/7.9  Moz;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  2013;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,  n.d.)  is  unusual  in  West  Africa  because  it  is  not  located  on  a  recognized  large  regional  scale  fault  system. || Keywords:  West  Africa,  Siguiri,  orogenic  gold,  laser  ablation,  geochemistry,  timing,  polyphase,  targeting  159 || Keywords: West Africa, Siguiri Basin, geochronology, lithostratigraphy, early architecture, gold  52 || Lawrence,  D.

Observations  from  five  representative  deposits  of  the  Siguiri  district  (Sanu  Tinti,  Bidini,  Kami,  Kosise  and  Sintroko PB1) show that these ore bodies are structurally controlled by incipient structures and  spread  across  three  distinct  structural  and  lithostratigraphic  domains. Two  shale-dominated  peripheral domains adjoin a central domain whose lithostratigraphy is dominated by medium  to  coarse-grained  greywacke  and  this  domain  hosts  the  bulk  of  the  gold  endowment  of  the  district. The three domains exhibit similar structural elements that can be described within a  four-stage  deformation  scheme. The  first  deformation  event  (D1S)  is  poorly  constrained  and  interpreted to have been a N-S compressional event. || and T.

Production  of  gold  from  this  region is thought to have continued through the 12th and 13th centuries in areas controlled by  the  Mindingo  Kingdom,  whose  capital  Niani  is  near  the  present  eastern  border  between  Guinea and Mali, less than 100 km from Siguiri. Continued gold production included its use as  tribute  by  the  Mali  Empire  during  the  17th  century. In  the  late  19th  and  early  20th  century,  minor  extraction  and  prospecting  in  the  Siguiri  area  was  started  by  the  French. Industrial  production of gold from the Siguiri district started in 1931 (nearly 75 t reported between 1931  and 1951)  (AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., 2013). Between 1960 and  1963 a Russian state  company  was  actively  mining  in  the  region,  focusing  their  operations  on  placer-type  deposits.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 94<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  district  has  been  the  site  of  a  protracted and polyphase deformation divided into four local deformation stages (D1S to D4S),  all of which are attributed to Eburnean orogenesis. D1S was a cryptic N-S compressional event. The  main  deformation  event  D2S,  was  an  E-W  to  ENE-WSW  directed  compressional  event  responsible  for  the  bulk  of  the  deformation  affecting  the  Siguiri  Basin  metasediments. D3S  represents  a  progressive  evolution  of  D2S  compression  into  an  E-W  transpressional  event,  evolving into a transient period of NNW-SSE transtension. This latter episode of deformation is  associated with the bulk of veining observed in the Siguiri district and is also the main stage of  mineralization.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Guinea<br><b>Pages:</b> 131<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Bidini  The  Bidini  deposit  is  located  in  the  northern  part  of  the  district  (Figure  17).

It is hosted  by  the  greywacke-dominated  Fatoya  Formation  and  is  located  east  of  the  contact  with  the  Kintinian Formation (Figure 35A). 172 || The  domes  and  basins  most  notably  developed  in  the  Kami  deposit,  could  therefore  have  developed  by  overprinting  of  the  F2S  N-S  folds  by  the  D4S  NW-SE  compression. The  V3B  mineralized veins located in these domes suggest that these domes developed pre- to syn-D3S  veining and thus cannot have formed by F2S/F4S interference. However, D4S may have amplified  the domes and basins. The S4S  dip angle and dip  direction varies  across the Siguiri district, from sub-vertical  and ESE- to WNW-dipping in the south, to shallowly SE-dipping in the north. Variations in S4S  dip angle and dip direction in the northern part of the district are interpreted to be related to  the  pre-existing  faults  and  the  rotation  of  cleavage  trajectories  around  these  structures,  a  mechanism described by Dewey et al. (1998).<br><b>Geocode:</b> District of Columbia, United States<br><b>Pages:</b> 115,119,157,96<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Therefore,  the  Siguiri  district  provides  a  unique  opportunity  to  characterise the alteration haloes associated with gold mineralisation found in the Basin. Laser  ablation  data  are  used  to  constrain  the  relative  timing  of  the  different  generations  of  pyrite  observed,  allowing  the  creation  of  a  district-scale  paragenetic  sequence,  which  serves  to  highlight  the  polyphase  nature  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district. Comparison  between  the  timing  of  the  main  gold  mineralisation  event  in  the  district  with  events  from  other orogenic gold systems of the West African Craton can elucidate the temporal patterns of  mineralisation on the regional scale, with implications for prospectivity.
