They  correspond  with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the  first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages  of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period  1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant  centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated  in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao. These  towns  are  respectively  situated  360  km  west,  450  km  north- northwest and 370 km northeast of Dem across the international border of present day Burkina Faso  and Mali.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Netherlands<br><b>Pages:</b> 64<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  protection  will  prevent  degradation and destruction of the heritage and consequently will preserve the values and history of  the  area  for  present  and  future  generations  of  Africa. The  Dem  region  is  important  to  a  fuller  understanding of the history and society of the Songhai Empire  – it thus adds to the archaeological  history of the African peoples.

Large amounts of iron were smelted in the Nile Valley. Iron reached eastern Africa by 200 BC,  and by 200 AD had been carried to the south by ancestors of the modern Bantu peoples, together with  farming.

Vegetation in Burkina Faso is predominantly sparse savannah grasslands, dry forest with occasional  18 || ASM is  normally  associated  with  significant  to  insignificant  production  of  ore,  poor  or  low-level  mining,  processing and extraction practices, illegal trading and access (Cameroon, 2002), conflict, corruption,  violence,  exploitation  and  human  rights  violations  (Bower,  1987;  ICMM,  2010),  poor  health  (HIV/AIDS,  mental  health,  prostitution,  high  mortality  and  sanitation),  poor  safety  (high  worker  morality, child versus adult), low levels of education and skill, environmental degradation (Hentschel  et al., 2002), pollution and regolith bioturbation, and/or an absence of security of tenure (Hein, 2007). Generally,  ASM  is  practiced  as  an  alternative  economic  activity  in  times  of  economic  stress  (Hoadley and Limpitlaw, 2004). ASM in Burkina Faso, where this study is located, extracts iron for  the production of agricultural tools, and gold and silver in exchange for money and food. Hentschel et  al. (2003)  divided  ASM  into  the  following  categories;  (a)  gold  rush  or  influx  (ICMM,  2010);  (b)  temporary operations fuelled by economic recession; (c) isolated and remote operations with little or  14 || Bamba,  O.,  Parisot,  J-C.,  Grandin,  G.,  Beauvais,  A.,  2002.

The study area is located near the village  of Dem and west of the Lac (Lake) Dem in the Goren greenstone belt. Figure  1.3:  Photographs  of  the  elders  of  the  village  of  Liligomde  who  provided  the  ethnographic  background to this study (a, b, e). Their information indicated that no artisanal mining for iron  had taken place at Dem in their lifetimes. The senior elders ranged in age from 75-104 and they  were  the  senior  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. || Further to this, in Burkina Faso, the general outcrop distribution of ferricrete indicates that the  surfaces have also been eroded, redeposited and cemented several times such that the current profile is  representative of several phases of ferricrete formation (Middleton et al., 1997). In fact, ferricrete may  overlie  one,  or  more  of  three  gently  inclined  laterite  pediments  that  formed  as  erosional  surfaces  between 45 Ma and 2 Ma (Beauvais et al., 2008). 2.4. Iron ore deposits in the WAC  The WAC hosts iron ore reserves that are hosted in large Palaeoproterozoic BIF (banded iron  formation) deposits (>6000  mt) of iron ore in the Man and Reguibat shields (Bronner et al., 1990). The BIF in greenstone belts are also a local source of iron (Milési et al., 1989). BIF's  are  fine  bedded  chemical  sedimentary  rocks  composed  of  chert  (amorphous  silica)  and  iron-bearing minerals with an iron content of greater than 30 wt% (USGS, 2000). || However,  laterites derived from weathering of basic or ultra-basic rocks, or host rocks that are enriched in iron,  such as iron-rich shales and siltstones, may be sufficiently rich in iron (and/or other elements such as  nickel) to be minable. This is the case in the Dem study area, where iron-rich laterite overlies iron-rich  shale host rocks of the Birimian Supergroup. In  contrast  to  laterite,  ferricrete  is  the  iron-cemented  duricrust  that  is  formed  by  various  processes  particularly  pedogenesis  (McFarlane,  1976). Generally  it  overlies  the  laterite  profile  in  Burkina  Faso  but  is  still  regarded  as  part  of  the  laterite  weathering  profile  (Schwartz,  1994). The  mineralogy of ferricrete is typically composed of goethite, limonite, lepicrocite, hematite in varying  proportions,  sometimes  with  minor  amounts  of  manganese  oxides,  and  residual  base  metal  sulfides  (Craig  and  Vaughan,  1994). The  profile  typically  presents  indurated  strata  rich  in  kaolinite  and  hematite (Nahon and Tardy, 1992). || Importantly, although the Museum of Kaya has a single ASM furnace on display to preserve  the techniques  of  iron  forging,  the  museum  indicated  that  no  research has ever  been  undertaken  on  iron  mining,  processing  and  production  anywhere  in  Burkina  Faso  and  certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. With this in mind, this study focuses on the historic mining, processing and production of iron  ore in the Dem region of Burkina Faso. Because the history is arguably lost, the techniques are not  known, the reasons for production are forgotten and the age of mine workings is no longer known,  this  study  records  the  size  and  dimensions  of  the  mine  sites,  waste  sites,  orebody  and  furnaces. It  records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the  processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings  in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and  could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century. || Kribek,  B.,  Syrokorova,  I.,  Machovic,  V.,  Laufek,  F.,  2008.

The  protection  will  prevent  degradation and destruction of the heritage and consequently will preserve the values and history of  the  area  for  present  and  future  generations  of  Africa. The  Dem  region  is  important  to  a  fuller  understanding of the history and society of the Songhai Empire  – it thus adds to the archaeological  history of the African peoples. There may be a case to motivate for World Heritage Status but further  research in the region is necessary. 70 || Some BIF deposits are formed from metal-rich brines that are expelled at active rift zones by  hydrothermal  activity. This  is  case  for  the  Faléme  iron  ore  deposits  which  are  the  largest  Palaeoproterozoic  iron  ore  deposits  in  the  WAC  (Combes,  1980;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). They  are  spatially associated with hydrothermal mineralisation associated with tourmalinisation, carbonisation,  chloritisation and albitisation of the host metasedimentary and volcanic rocks (Bassot, 1997). Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  Tin  Edia  deposit  of  the  Oudalan  province  in  Burkina  Faso  (Neyberg  et  al.,  1980). The  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  veins  which  crosscut  gabbro,  gabbro- norite  and  norite  intrusions  as  magnetite  and  ilmenite,  with  accessory  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite  and  arsenopyrite  (Castaing  et  al.,  2003). Iron-titanium  ores  mostly  consist  of  titaniferous-magnetite  in  association with ulvospinel and ilmenite. || The  tuyere  is  clearly  visible. A  goat  skin  bellows  would  have  been  placed over the bellows hole to pump air into the tuyere. This particular working forge is on exhibition at the  Museum of Kaya and is presented with the permission of the Museum. The Dem region is situated 17 km north-northwest of the town of Kaya in Burkina Faso (Figure  1.2). Burkina  Faso’s  rural  economy  is  dependent  on  agriculture,  and  seasonal  artisanal  small  and  medium-scale  mining  (ASM)  for  livelihoods. According  to  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso  there have been no studies of ASM for iron in Burkina Faso, and there are no records of iron mining  and processing for the Dem region. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD. || The process of  finding  adequate  markets  for  minerals  in  the  ASM  sector  is  also  difficult  and  may  be  disorganized  (United Nations, 2002) and trade tends to follow along traditional or informal trade routes, or occurs  within the same country. ASM sites are also associated with health, safety and environmental problems. Lovitz (2006)  stated that poor health and safety, and the use of environmentally destructive mining and processing  practices  draw  criticism  to  the  sector. The  health,  safety  and  environmental  problems  are  often  aggravated  by  inadequate  regulatory  frameworks  governing  ASM  in  many  developing  countries,  especially in Africa. Nonetheless, although ASM may be associated with negative impacts, it provides  a  means  of  livelihood, jobs  and  business  opportunities  to  millions  of  people  across  the  world. This  includes ASM in Burkina Faso both in a modern and historic context. || cit.). Gold mining has recently become  an  important  economic  aspect  of  development  in  Burkina  Faso,  with  gold  producing  mines  in  the  northeast  and  southwest  at  Essakane  gold  mining  (Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  2013)  and  Mana  gold  mining districts, respectively. 1.3. Geology of the study area  Burkina Faso lies on the West African Craton (WAC). Burkina Faso is generally characterized  by  granitic  gneiss,  and  also  north to  northeast-trending  belts  of  metasedimentary  and  meta-volcanic  rocks  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  (ca. 2.3  Ga)  that  are  intruded  by  trondjemite- tonalite-granodiorite plutons (ca. || shrub  vegetation,  or  acacia  forest. The  country  has  a  subtropical  Sahelian  climate  with  two  distinct  seasons, i.e., rainy season and dry season. The  dry  season  lasts  for  eight  to  nine  months  with  a  rainy  season  from  June  to  September  (Bierschenk, 1968). Burkina Faso is characterised by low hills and alluvial plains, and is covered by  an extensive laterite plateau which is locally mined as a source for iron ore, or for alluvial gold. Land use can be divided into (1) land that includes pastures, woodland, forest, built-up areas,  barren lands and roads, and which total 82% of all land in Burkina Faso; (2) arable land that is mainly  cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (e.g., rice, maize, wheat) and which only total  17% of all land; and (3) permanent cultivated land that cannot be replanted after harvest (e.g. coffee,  rubber) and which makes up 1% of all land (Bierschenk, op. || tradition of significant elders of the Mossi people. The Dem site is thus an archaeological curiosity  and may provide a link with the historic mining history of the people of West Africa.

The  vegetation at the valley is presently dominated by large trees and savannah forest. It seems possible  that the historic Dem forest could  have provided the source of fuel (charcoal) during iron smelting,  and perhaps a ready source of water. A source of flux is also important in iron ore production. Flux is used as a reducing agent that  facilitates  the  chemical  reaction  and  separates  the  molten  metal  from  the  waste  (slag)  in  smelting. Some fluxes used in smelting include carbonate and quartz. || Chapter  Three  presents  the  Methodology  used  in  this  research;  it  also  describes  in  detail  the  different  techniques  used  for  data  acquisition,  data  analysis,  interpretation  and  the  final  product  of  every  stage. Some  of  the  methods  included  GIS  evaluation,  petrography,  ore  petrology  and  dating. GIS evaluation involved the use CorelDraw® and GoogleEarth® for data processing and interpretation. This helped establish the location of mine sites, furnaces, artefacts, river profiles and contacts. Chapter Four describes the Mine Site at Dem, its mining footprint and the layout of the mine  sites, processing sites, mines, and waste dumps. 20 || In the study area a considerable amount of  crushed  quartz  and  outcrops  of  quartz  veins  occurs  both  in  the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are  carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. It is possible that quartz  was the main flux, but further study is needed to clarify this aspect of iron ore production at Dem. An important aspect of the greater mining footprint of the Dem ASM site are the many tracks,  which stand proud in the eroding fossil aeolian landscape. Tracks in desert aeolian sands are difficult  to  eradicate  and  can  remain  for  decades  as  trace  fossils  as  evidenced  from  rehabilitation  programs  around  the  world  which  want to  remove  tire and track  damage  in  deserts  (Burke  and  Cloete,  2004;  Wassenaar et al., 2013). In the Dem study area, tracks are pressed into the fossil alluvial soil (that is  currently being eroded) and these lead from mine to furnaces and processing sites, and from the east  of  the  mine  site  region  where  the  historic  Dem  forest  is  speculated  to  have  been  situated,  to  the  furnaces. || Interstitial  areas  are  filled  with  oxide  minerals  that  make  up  the  matrix  producing  an  iron  rich  quartz  breccia. The  iron  oxides are dominated by hematite and/or magnetite that are replaced by spinel. Patches and veins of  oxidised iron form part of the thin-section. 5.4. Slag geology and petrology  Slag is found at several furnace sites at Dem. The slag contains primary slag phases including  oxides, silicates, sulphides and the metal phase. || The  furnace materials included charcoal on fragments of broken furnace bricks and samples of slag. All  samples  were  transported  to  the  University  of  the  Witwatersrand  Johannesburg  for  laboratory work. At the university, the lithology samples were catalogued and sent to the School of  Geosciences thin-section laboratory for preparation, while metallurgical and ore body samples were  sent  to  the  SGS  Laboratory  in  Booysens  for  polished  block  preparation. Carbon  samples  were  packaged and shipped to the Beta Analytic laboratory in Miami, Florida, USA. 3.4. Petrography  A total of 59 samples were collected (Appendix 3) from sites of interest at Dem including host  rocks,  ore  bearing  rocks  and  slag  and  petrographic  sections  were  made. || The  dominant  mineral  phases  in  the  shale  and  siltstone  that  are  the  host  rocks  to  iron  ore  at  Dem  are  unsurprisingly  quartz,  mica  and  carbonate,  with  accessory  feldspar,  graphite  and  rarely  magnetite. Petrographically the ore bearing rocks consist of goethite-hematite as the dominant oxides  with silica. 68 || The  slower  cooled  slag  exhibits  phaneritic  texture with crystals that are large in size (c.f., Craddock and Meeks, 1987; van Oss, 2002). The fast  cooling rate exhibits an aphanitic texture wherein the slag will have small crystals with vesicles. The  rapid  cooling  rate  produced  a  granular  or  glassy  texture  with  very  fine  crystals  that  resemble  the  volcanic rock obsidian (c.f., van Oss, 2002; Stewart, 2007). Ethnographic research indicated that ASM of iron ore from the Dem site did not take place in  the  last  80  years  or  1932-2012. Additionally,  the  Museum  of  Kaya  and  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso  does  not record iron  workings  at  Dem  over  the  last  hundred  years. There  are  also  no  other historic records of iron making at Dem. || The ore might have been man-hauled to  the surface in bags or sacks particularly because there is no evidence at the Dem site of mechanical  aids for hoisting and hauling ore. It is possible that the open cast operations were mined by women,  children  and  aged  persons,  as  can  be  witnessed  at  ASM  sites  throughout  Burkina  Faso  and  West  Africa, with the underground operations being the domain of men. Different  types  of  slag  were  dumped  proximal  to  the  furnace  sites  and  included  (1)  a  dense  black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy type resembling an  obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a spinifex-like texture  due  to  quenching  at  high  temperature,  and  (4)  a  clay  containing  pumice-like  slag  with  vugs  that  formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. A considerable amount of clean crushed quartz and outcrops of quartz veins occurs both in the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally,  which  may  have  been  used  as  a  flux  in  the  smelting  process. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are  carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. At Dem, an immediate source of charcoal could have been from the valleys to the east of the  ASM site which today hosts dams for irrigation and extensive market gardens. || resources (iron ore, charcoal, clay, water and flux), (2) the choice of trees for making charcoal and  transporting them to the processing site, (3) clay collection for furnace construction and production of  tuyere  and  crucibles,  and  (4)  distribution  of  the  final  product  after  smelting. Presumably,  historic  smelters  could  possibly  choose  the  smelting  site  near  at  least  one  resource. Certainly,  the  iron-rich  resources  at  Dem  gave  reason  for  the  other  industries  to  exist;  tuyere,  crucible  and  furnace  brick  production is interpreted to have taken place locally from orange aeolian sand which covers the Dem  study area. Charcoal was the most appropriate fuel for the smelting of iron ore in ancient times but the type  of  wood  used  in  the  Dem  study  area  is  a  subject  of  speculation. Charcoal  is  a  by-product  of  dry  distillation  of  wood  and  contains  high  carbon  content  (Karbowniczek,  2005). It  is  advantageous  because it is easy to produce, has low ash content, contains no sulphur and has a high caloric value  meaning, it can maintain very high temperatures in a small volume (Craddock, 1995).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Netherlands<br><b>Pages:</b> 20,34,50,54,67,68<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

It  must also have been economically  viable because a considerable amount of human capital and skill  was expended at the site. Ore dressing and processing extended over a considerable area of the study  site. 4.5. The greater mining footprint  The  Dem  ASM  site  is  located  2km  west  of  the  Dem  village,  which  is  situated  at  latitude  13°11'17.528" and longitude 1°10'43.199"W. According to Haaland et al. || In the study area a considerable amount of  crushed  quartz  and  outcrops  of  quartz  veins  occurs  both  in  the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are  carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. It is possible that quartz  was the main flux, but further study is needed to clarify this aspect of iron ore production at Dem. An important aspect of the greater mining footprint of the Dem ASM site are the many tracks,  which stand proud in the eroding fossil aeolian landscape. Tracks in desert aeolian sands are difficult  to  eradicate  and  can  remain  for  decades  as  trace  fossils  as  evidenced  from  rehabilitation  programs  around  the  world  which  want to  remove  tire and track  damage  in  deserts  (Burke  and  Cloete,  2004;  Wassenaar et al., 2013). In the Dem study area, tracks are pressed into the fossil alluvial soil (that is  currently being eroded) and these lead from mine to furnaces and processing sites, and from the east  of  the  mine  site  region  where  the  historic  Dem  forest  is  speculated  to  have  been  situated,  to  the  furnaces. || RECOMMENDATIONS  The Dem ASM site should be protected and conserved as a historic and cultural monument by  the  relevant  authorities  in  Burkina  Faso  at  state  and  provincial  levels. The  protection  will  prevent  degradation and destruction of the heritage and consequently will preserve the values and history of  the  area  for  present  and  future  generations  of  Africa. The  Dem  region  is  important  to  a  fuller  understanding of the history and society of the Songhai Empire  – it thus adds to the archaeological  history of the African peoples. There may be a case to motivate for World Heritage Status but further  research in the region is necessary. 70 || Slag was dumped near the smelting sites (furnaces) and also close to  the ore sources. The layout of the Dem ASM site is presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The  host  rocks  to  the  iron  ore  deposits  included  metamorphosed  shale,  siltstone,  low  grade  laterite-ferricrete  and  mineralised  quartz  cataclasite  veins. At least  one  mine  site,  the  host  rock  was  mangacrete. 4.2.

The  characteristics  of  slag  such  as  the  volume,  density,  porosity  and  grain  size  is  influenced  by  the  cooling  rate,  temperature  and  the  chemical  composition  of  the  iron  ore,  flux,  charcoal and clay. Higher temperatures decrease the viscosity of the melt. Different  types  of  slag  (Figure  4.7)  were  dumped  at  different  locations  in  the  Dem  area  and  included (1) a dense black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy  type resembling an obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a  spinifex-like texture due to quenching at high temperature, and (4) a clay containing pumice-like slag  with vugs that formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. Due to high silica content of the slag, it is resistant to weathering, thus large amounts of slag  fragments  were  found  at  the  ASM  site. Slag  waste  around  Furnace  5  was  significant  and  extended  away from the furnaces up to 25-40 metres; it may have produced more slag and was bigger than all  the other furnaces. || Hogg (1992) categorised the natural contaminants into (1) carbonates, (2) plant rootlets, and (3)  humic acids (Cresswell, 1992). Carbonates make the sample to appear older than its true age due to its older geological age,  and  although  there  are  no  carbonates  in  the  Dem  area,  the  iron-rich  shales  are  carbonaceous. Consequently, it became imperative that CaCO3 be removed from the sample during the pre-treatment  stage as described in Section 3.5, and as a precaution. Plant  rootlets  growing  in  the  material  of  interest  can  also  introduce  additional  carbon. It  is  possible that plants grew in the study area at some time because the Dem region grows Sahelian grass,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  growth  fluctuates  dramatically  according  to  intensity  and  duration  of  rainfall. In this context, humic acids may have circulated through the sample by the process known as  37<br><b>Geocode:</b> Netherlands<br><b>Pages:</b> 37,48<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

THE MINE SITE AT DEM  4.1. Introduction  The  mining  of  iron  ore  in  the  Dem  study  area  produced  a  limited  number  of  underground  workings and surface open pits. These mine workings show no modern mechanised mining method of  operating. The  surveyed  ASM  site  covers  1.9  km  by  1.3  km. About  four  ore  extraction  areas  and  eleven  smelting  sites  were  located  during  field  studies  but  a  broader  study  of  the  Dem  region  is  warranted. || 6.2. Interpretation of the results of carbon dating  The  conventional  radiocarbon  ages  (95%  probability)  from  the  Dem  iron  mine  site  cover  the  Roman  calendar  ages  of  1430-1480,  1640-1680,  1740-1800  and  1940-1950  AD  Samples  FOR02- 01CAR,  FOR05-02CAR,  FOR09-01CAR,  and  FOR11-01CAR  from  furnaces  2,  5,  9  and  11,  respectively,  gave  modern  dating  results,  which  are  0  BP,  thus  indicating  that  modern  material  had  been  introduced  during  the  last  60  years  or  so. Based  on  the  ethnographic  evidence  presented  in  Section 3.2, mining, processing or forging of iron did not occur in the Dem region in the last 80 years,  and thus these samples can reasonably be assumed to have been contaminated with  modern organic  material and can be excluded as non-significant. However,  the  2σ  calibrated  ages  (95%  probability)  for  samples  FOR06-02CAR  and  FOR08- 01CAR arguably suggest that forging of iron may have been active in the Dem region at Furnace 6 at  1430-1480 AD, and at Furnace 8 at 1640-1680 AD and 1740-1800 AD The samples were collected  from deep in the furnace pile, with access being made easy because the sides of the furnaces had been  breached and collapsed into a small rivulet. Consequently, the furnace stratigraphy was exposed over  approximately  60  centimetres  of  depth  (Figures  6.1d,  e). Furnace  6  and  8  are  situated  immediately  east of the open cast and underground mines (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). || A list of  samples is presented in Appendix 2. Petrographic  and  mineralogical  studies:  selected  samples  of  the  lithologies,  host  rocks,  ore  body and slag were investigated to establish the lithological type and slag characteristics. The list  of selected samples for petrography is given in Appendix 3. Carbon isotopes and AMS radiocarbon dating: A total of six carbon samples were dated using  radiometric  and  accelerator  mass  spectrometry  (AMS)  at  Beta  Analytic  Laboratories  in  Miami,  Florida, USA. 3.2. Ethnographic research  This  study  used  ethnographic  methods  and  research  as  a  first  pass  to  establish  the  history  of  artisanal  mining  of  iron  in  the  Kaya  region,  and  specifically  the  Dem  region. || B. Ferricrete  overlying massive siltstone unit in the Dem region. C. Ferricrete plateau in the background is  composed  of  the  profile  in  photograph  D. Several  layers  of  ferricrete  development  can  be  interpreted from the profile. Figure 4.3: The two surface mines consist of bowl-shaped opencast pits that are approximately 500- 600m  in  diameter. || Consultations with senior elders in the village of Liligomde near  Kaya (Figure 1.3), who were the chief blacksmiths of the Chief Naba of the Mossi people (the Chief  Naba’s  residence  is  in  the  village  of  Boussouma,  19  km  southeast  of  Kaya),  clearly  argued  that  mining of iron in the Dem region, or for any metal commodity, or any artisanal mining in the Dem  region, had not occurred in the last 80 years, i.e., mining in the Dem region is not recorded in oral  15 || Ethnographic research  argued  that mining of iron in the Dem region, or any significant artisanal mining in the Dem region for any  metal  commodity,  had  not  occurred  in  the  last  80-90  years. Although  speculative,  the  limited  radiocarbon  results  for  sample  FOR06-02CAR  may  suggest  a  link  between  the  Dem  site  and  the  demand  for  metal  in  the  region  during  the  15th  century,  European  expansion  in  the  17th  to  18th  centuries. 69 || Ferricrete overlying massive siltstone  unit in the Dem region. C. Ferricrete plateau in the background is composed of the profile in photograph D. Several layers of ferricrete development can be interpreted from the profile. In  summary,  there  are  two  types  of  ore  deposits  in  the  study  area;  vein  hosted  and  laterite- ferricrete hosted. The range of ore types mined was extensive and varied from high grade magnetite to  low grade laterite. || Hogg (1992) categorised the natural contaminants into (1) carbonates, (2) plant rootlets, and (3)  humic acids (Cresswell, 1992). Carbonates make the sample to appear older than its true age due to its older geological age,  and  although  there  are  no  carbonates  in  the  Dem  area,  the  iron-rich  shales  are  carbonaceous. Consequently, it became imperative that CaCO3 be removed from the sample during the pre-treatment  stage as described in Section 3.5, and as a precaution. Plant  rootlets  growing  in  the  material  of  interest  can  also  introduce  additional  carbon. It  is  possible that plants grew in the study area at some time because the Dem region grows Sahelian grass,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  growth  fluctuates  dramatically  according  to  intensity  and  duration  of  rainfall. In this context, humic acids may have circulated through the sample by the process known as  37 || Importantly, although the Museum of Kaya has a single ASM furnace on display to preserve  the techniques  of  iron  forging,  the  museum  indicated  that  no  research has ever  been  undertaken  on  iron  mining,  processing  and  production  anywhere  in  Burkina  Faso  and  certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. With this in mind, this study focuses on the historic mining, processing and production of iron  ore in the Dem region of Burkina Faso. Because the history is arguably lost, the techniques are not  known, the reasons for production are forgotten and the age of mine workings is no longer known,  this  study  records  the  size  and  dimensions  of  the  mine  sites,  waste  sites,  orebody  and  furnaces. It  records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the  processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings  in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and  could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century. || Interviews  were  conducted  with  community  members  of  the  towns  of  Liligomde  and  Kaya,  which are the two local centres of artisanal mining for iron and gold. No interviews were held without  the  expressed  permission  of  the  senior  elders  of  the  villages. Data  was  recorded  in  a  notebook;  translations  from  Mossi  to  French  and  English  where  facilitated  by  Mr  Bamogo  Makido  of  the  Museum of Kaya and all notes were recorded in English. Several consultations were specifically conducted with two groups of senior elders (ages ranged  from 75 to 101 years of age) of the village of Liligomde near Kaya (Figure 1.3), who were the former  chief  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. The  results  of  the  consultations  clearly  argued that mining of iron in the Dem region, or any significant artisanal mining in the Dem region  for any metal commodity, had not occurred in the last 80-90 years, i.e., mining in the Dem region is  not recorded in oral tradition of the significant elders of the Mossi people. In fact, the consultations  recorded that mining for iron for primarily agricultural purposes only took place at a site immediately  west of the village of Liligomde and not at Dem. || Metallic  iron  was  used for  decorative  purposes  and  weapons in  prehistoric  times  (Bahn  et  al.,  1994). The  most  primitive  sample  is  a  cluster  of  oxidized  iron  beads  found  in  Egypt that date from 4000 BC. Historically, there was virtually no use of metals in sub-Saharan Africa before 500 BC, when  both iron and copper came into use in the savannah and forest regions of West Africa (Smith et al.,  1993). Large amounts of iron were smelted in the Nile Valley. Iron reached eastern Africa by 200 BC,  and by 200 AD had been carried to the south by ancestors of the modern Bantu peoples, together with  farming. However, the age of iron in the Dem region is not known and establishing its age may be  important to the mining history and heritage of the African continent. || Project aims  The aims of this project include:     To map the Dem mine site footprint, its geology and geography. To identify the characteristics of the Dem ore deposit including its mineralogy and host rocks. Determine  the  methods  of mining,  processing  and  production  of  iron  ore  as  reasonably  can  be  reconstructed. To establish the mineralogy and metallurgy of the slag. To provide a first pass estimate of the absolute age of iron mining and the age of the furnaces. To reconstruct the mining history of iron mining in the Dem region. || Quartz  vein  cataclasite veins surrounded by a wide alteration zone of iron enriched siltstone. D.

D. A complex zone of alteration in massive siltstone. Across  the  West  African  Craton,  an  extensive  laterite-ferricrete  plateau  is  locally  mined  as  a  source for iron ore for the agricultural industry (Figure 4.2), such as near the village of Liligomde near  Kaya). In  the  Dem  region,  ferricrete  overlying  iron-rich  shale  was  clearly  mined  artisanally  as  a  source  of  iron,  along  with  primary  iron  in  the  alteration  selvages  around  buck  quartz  veins  that  crosscut the iron-rich shale. Laterite-ferricrete type iron ores are derived from the sub-aerial alteration of rocks (Beukes et  al., 2002). || RECOMMENDATIONS  The Dem ASM site should be protected and conserved as a historic and cultural monument by  the  relevant  authorities  in  Burkina  Faso  at  state  and  provincial  levels. The  protection  will  prevent  degradation and destruction of the heritage and consequently will preserve the values and history of  the  area  for  present  and  future  generations  of  Africa. The  Dem  region  is  important  to  a  fuller  understanding of the history and society of the Songhai Empire  – it thus adds to the archaeological  history of the African peoples. There may be a case to motivate for World Heritage Status but further  research in the region is necessary. 70 || The  Dem  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  (GGB)  which  comprises  meta- volcanic  and  pyroclastic  units  that  are  interbedded  with  meta-sedimentary  rocks  (Hein  et  al.,  2004;  2010). Carbonaceous  manganese-rich  shale  beds  and  tholeiitic  dacitic  rocks  are  interbedded  with  volcanic units (Kříbek et al., 2008). Based  on  a  reconnaissance  geological  survey  conducted  in  November-December  2010,  the  Dem  region  consists  of  metamorphosed  basalt,  siltstone,  iron  formations  and  shale  units  that  are  unconformably  overlain  by  a  10  m  thick  silcrete-laterite-ferricrete  duricrust.

Burkina  Faso’s  rural  economy  is  dependent  on  agriculture,  and  seasonal  artisanal  small  and  medium-scale  mining  (ASM)  for  livelihoods. According  to  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso  there have been no studies of ASM for iron in Burkina Faso, and there are no records of iron mining  and processing for the Dem region. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD. || concentrated  on  the  upper  surface  of  the  regolith  as  a  supergene  product  of  the  iron-bearing  host  rocks.

Pilot study - AMS radiocarbon dating  The  main  aim  of  dating  the  charcoal  samples  using  limited  AMS  radiocarbon  dating  was  to  constrain the age of forging as a proxy for artisanal mining activity at the Dem region through dating  of forge charcoal which was assumed to have formed at the same time as mining and processing took  place. The sampling of furnaces was undertaken as a pilot study in 2011, with a view to a focussed  comprehensive  study  if  the  pilot  study  was  successful,  but  limited  funding  has  meant  that  a  comprehensive study has not been possible to date. There  are  three  primary  carbon  isotopes  that  are  12C,  13C  and  14C. 14C  is  radioactive  whereas  isotopes 12C and 13C are stable (Vogel et al., 1993). || The  tuyere  is  clearly  visible. A  goat  skin  bellows  would  have  been  placed over the bellows hole to pump air into the tuyere.

It  records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the  processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings  in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and  could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 18<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Olson  (1979)  argued  that  the  Songhay  economy  was  a  clan  based  system  linked  to  artisanal  skill  (craft  guilds),  with  the  most  important being metalwork, mechanics and carpentry; the regional economy was dependant on gold  and iron. Trade in gold, iron and salt where central to the Songhai economy and fundamental to its  power base (Masonen, 1997; Park, 2011).

Their information indicated that no artisanal mining for iron had taken place at Dem in their  lifetimes. The senior elders ranged in age from 75-104 and they were the senior blacksmiths of the Chief Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. Artisanal mining for iron is conducted west of the village of Liligomde (c) with smelting in the village on small  crucibles. Iron rich spongy ferricrete is used for smelting (d) which makes tools for local agricultural use. || Figure 3.1: Photographic mosaic of the Dem site constructed from GoogleEarth images.

C. || Interestingly,  although  quite  limited  in  number,  the  ages  correspond  broadly  with  the  rapid  expansion  of  iron  technology  from  1400-1600  AD  in  West  Africa  (Todd,  1979). They  correspond  with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the  first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages  of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period  1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant  centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated  in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao. These  towns  are  respectively  situated  360  km  west,  450  km  north- northwest and 370 km northeast of Dem across the international border of present day Burkina Faso  and Mali. || Iron production at the Dem site was Bloomery furnace smelting, where a fluid state of iron was  produced. The quality of ore produced is not known as there is no iron metal artefact discovered but  could  have  ranged  from  soft  iron  to  steel. This  suggests  that  a  good  level  of  smelting  knowledge  existed at the time. However, due to the variation of magnetite and hematite content the samples studied, it can be  argued that smelting practices were variable from one furnace to another. Furnaces 1, 3, 4 and 5 were  more  efficient  than  furnaces  9,  10,  due  to  the  amount  of  Fe-oxide  in  the  slag  and  the  physical  appearance  of  the  slag. Iron  smelting  took  place  at  different  cooling  rates  and  encompassed  slow  cooling  rate,  fast  cooling  rate  and  rapid  cooling  rate. || It can thus be reasonably interpreted that the Dem site predates modern iron making in the Kaya  region. Radiocarbon  dates  given  for  the  last  80  years  were  thus  discounted. The  age  of  mining,  processing and production is thus tentatively constrained by radiocarbon dating to have been active in  1438-1458 AD, 1600-1651 AD, or 1756-1759 AD. Iron was initially forged in West Africa as early as the 6th century (Insoll, 1997; Pleiner, 2000)  and iron smelting was practiced in the southeast of Burkina Faso by the Bura  culture whose culture  was focused in the region 250 km southeast of Dem. Iron forging and smelting was thus known to the  peoples of West Africa. By the 15th century, forging and smelting of iron (and gold) where central to  the region and particularly, the Songhay economy which dominated trade in the region. || Lac  Dem  is  located  east  of  the  town  of  Dem. Figure 3.2: Geology and layout of the Dem site. Open cast mines 1-3 are located on the eastern side  of  a  ridge  of  ferricrete  duricrust  and  immediately  east  of  ferricrete  scree  in  Fe-Mn  rich  metasedimentary rocks, and adit to UG 1-2 underground mines is located above the open casts. Forges/Furnaces  1-11  are  situated  on  the  alluvium  plain  blow  the  open  cast  mines. Waste  dumps are situated proximal to the furnace sites. Figure 4.1: Photographs of vein-hosted iron ore from adits in the underground mines of the Dem iron  site. || The  slower  cooled  slag  exhibits  phaneritic  texture with crystals that are large in size (c.f., Craddock and Meeks, 1987; van Oss, 2002). The fast  cooling rate exhibits an aphanitic texture wherein the slag will have small crystals with vesicles. The  rapid  cooling  rate  produced  a  granular  or  glassy  texture  with  very  fine  crystals  that  resemble  the  volcanic rock obsidian (c.f., van Oss, 2002; Stewart, 2007). Ethnographic research indicated that ASM of iron ore from the Dem site did not take place in  the  last  80  years  or  1932-2012. Additionally,  the  Museum  of  Kaya  and  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso  does  not record iron  workings  at  Dem  over  the  last  hundred  years. There  are  also  no  other historic records of iron making at Dem. || The  volcano-sedimentary  formation  in  the  northeast  portion  of  the  WAC  contains  stratiform  deposits  of  iron-rich  shale,  manganese  and  manganese-iron-carbonate  deposits  particularly  in  the  northeast  of  Burkina  Faso  at  Tambão  (Kimberly,  1989;  Beauvais  et  al.,  2008)  and  Billiata  (Tshibubudze and Hein, 2013). Manganiferous iron ore deposits are formed by the leaching of silica,  carbon dioxide, magnesia and minor amounts of other constituents. In addition, some manganiferous  deposits  are  formed  by  the  local  migration  of  iron  and  manganese  that  produced  space  filling  and  replacement  of  silica. Manganese  iron  ore  deposits  are  formed  on  the  seafloor  and  build-up  as  chemical sediments together with additional sedimentary or volcanic detritus (Dasgupta et al., 1999;  Mücke, 2005 suggesting that perhaps the formation of the iron and manganese deposits is related to  seafloor exhalite processes. In  the  Goren  greenstone  belt,  in  which  the  Dem  site  is  located,  Fe-rich  siltstone  shale  and  siltstone  are  sometimes  manganiferous  and  intercalated  with  volcaniclastic  meta-greywacke,  meta- siltstone with minor resedimented pyroclastic deposits (Peters and Hein, 2013). However, repetitious  successions  of  Fe-rich  low  grade  metamorphosed  siltstones,  fine-grained,  carbonaceous,  Fe-rich  exhalative and volcaniclastic units are typically intercalated with the basalt units. || The ore might have been man-hauled to  the surface in bags or sacks particularly because there is no evidence at the Dem site of mechanical  aids for hoisting and hauling ore. It is possible that the open cast operations were mined by women,  children  and  aged  persons,  as  can  be  witnessed  at  ASM  sites  throughout  Burkina  Faso  and  West  Africa, with the underground operations being the domain of men. Different  types  of  slag  were  dumped  proximal  to  the  furnace  sites  and  included  (1)  a  dense  black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy type resembling an  obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a spinifex-like texture  due  to  quenching  at  high  temperature,  and  (4)  a  clay  containing  pumice-like  slag  with  vugs  that  formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. A considerable amount of clean crushed quartz and outcrops of quartz veins occurs both in the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally,  which  may  have  been  used  as  a  flux  in  the  smelting  process. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are  carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. At Dem, an immediate source of charcoal could have been from the valleys to the east of the  ASM site which today hosts dams for irrigation and extensive market gardens. || The ore was dominantly composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3), with impurities of  SiO2,  as  occurs  in  many  ancient  iron  and  copper  sites  that  produce  an  iron  silicate  slag  of  low  temperature  (1200°C)  slag  (Craddock  and  Meeks,  1987). The  magnetite-hematite  rich  veins  were  structurally controlled in the host rocks. Lateritic ore also provided a second source of iron-rich rock  for mining at the Dem site. Processing  sites  comprised  at  least  11  furnaces  that  were  dome  and  circular  in  shape. The  furnaces were filled with crucibles and tuyeres made of clay sand perhaps sourced  locally from the  alluvial plain  on  which  the  furnaces are  situated  or the  Dem  Valley  which is  now  occupied  by  Lac  Dem (Figures 3.1; 3.2). Crucibles and tuyeres litter the furnace sites as waste or are welded together  with  slag  in  the  base  of  the  furnace  structure. || The waste rock in the mine sites was dumped near the open casts and underground mines. Open casts  tend to produce more waste than underground mines where a minimal quantity of waste was removed  to gain access to the ore deposit (Hudson et al., 1999). It is thus that the largest waste piles are located  next to the opencast mines. Waste  from  the  furnaces  included  slag  and  furnace  fragments  which  were  dumped  after  smelting and within metres of the furnaces (Figure 4.6). Processing sites were also located proximal to  the furnace sites. Figure 4.6: Processing sites at the Dem site. || Waste  areas  are  situated  adjacent  to  most  furnaces  suggesting a modest level of industrial activity ranging from mining or ore, processing and cleaning,  building  of  furnaces,  making  of  crucibles  and  tuyeres,  and  processing  the  slag  after  smelting. The  presence of at least 11 furnaces with significant mining and processing of ore  suggests that the Dem  site may have been an important historic iron producing region. A source of fuel remains speculative but the location of the mine site adjacent to the Lac Dem,  which  historically  was  a  wooden  valley  prior  to  the  damming  of  the  lake,  may  have  meant  that  a  source of fuel in the form of timber was readily available. In any case, timber for charcoal may have  been  transported  to  the  site  in  the  same  way  that  timber  for  charcoal  is  transported  to  the  growing  urban centres nearby from the forest surrounding the region (Kramer, 2002; Ouedraogo et al., 2010). A source of flux may have the carbonaceous rocks and quartz that form part of the host rocks of  the region, or waste rock to the iron ore. A source of clean limestone which would make an ideal flux  does not occur in the region according to regional maps of Hottin and Ouedraogo (1992), Hein et al. || no  involvement  with nearby  communities;  (d)  seasonal  ASM  activities  within  an  agricultural  cycle;  and  (e)  traditional  year-around  activities  that  are  generally  associated  with  stable  communities  (or  ‘permanent  cohabitation’  of  ICMM,  2010). ASM  is  ultimately  maintained  by  the  demand  for  a  commodity in question (e.g., gold, tantalum, iron, diamonds and sand). ASM of iron in the Sahelian-Saharan rural sector is often characterised by one man with one  small furnace, one pump and one crucible (Figure 1.1 and Frontispiece), although increasingly ASM  of  iron  recycles  steel. However,  the  Dem  site  which  covers  an  area  in  access  of  2  km2  presents  a  significant  scale  of  mining,  with  11  large  furnaces  and  hundreds  of  crucibles,  and  a  large  mining  footprint. Importantly, the site is not modern as evidenced by small grassed fossil dunes of sand which  cover forging sites and are presently undergoing erosion to expose aspects of the mining area.

It is interpreted  to mean that the local sand was mined or harvested in the production of crucibles (probably made by  hand).

Location and physiography  The Dem study area is located in the Sanmatenga District of northeast Burkina Faso. Burkina  Faso is a landlocked country that covers 274 300 km2 (Bierschenk, 1968) and shares its borders with  Mali, Togo, Benin, Ghana, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire. The capital city is Ouagadougou and is located in  the  geographic  centre  of  the  country. The  average  daily  temperature  is  recorded  as  32°C  and  the  average annual rainfall is less than 25 centimetres in the north and northeast (McFarland et al., 1998). Vegetation in Burkina Faso is predominantly sparse savannah grasslands, dry forest with occasional  18 || 3.3. Fieldwork and geological mapping  This  research  is  based  on  one  phase  of  fieldwork. The  fieldwork  took  place  in  November- December  2010  over  a  period  of  17  days  and  recorded  the  geology  of  the  iron  orebody  that  was  mined, the type and number of mines, ore dressing and processing techniques (as reasonably could be  established) and the greater mining footprint; the results of field studies is presented in Chapter Four. A total of 93 rock, mine site, carbon and metallurgical samples were collected in the study area  and  transported  to  the  University  of  Witwatersrand  Johannesburg. Geological  surface  mapping  was  conducted throughout the Dem study area which is located in the Goren Greenstone Belt of Burkina  33 || 4. THE MINE SITE AT DEM  4.1. Introduction  The  mining  of  iron  ore  in  the  Dem  study  area  produced  a  limited  number  of  underground  workings and surface open pits. These mine workings show no modern mechanised mining method of  operating. The  surveyed  ASM  site  covers  1.9  km  by  1.3  km. About  four  ore  extraction  areas  and  eleven  smelting  sites  were  located  during  field  studies  but  a  broader  study  of  the  Dem  region  is  warranted. || All of these are the sources of errors that need to be taken into consideration when  analysing and interpreting the 14C ages. Accelerator  Mass  Spectrometry  (AMS)  radiocarbon  dating  is  a  technique  that  is  based  on  detecting and counting the amount of beta radiation emitted in a unit time by radiocarbon atoms in a  sample of known weight (Guo et al., 2000). This technique usually provides reliable results and is also  based  on  counting  the  relative  amount  of  radiocarbon  to  stable  carbon  isotopes  in  a  sample  with  a  mass spectrometer (Oda et al., 2000). The technique requires very small samples (usually below one  gram in weight) and the time necessary to measure the amount of radiocarbon in each sample is only a  few minutes. For  pilot  AMS  radiocarbon  dating,  six  samples  with  a  wide  range  of  carbon  content  were  selected  from  different  furnace  sites  in  the  Dem  study  area  including  samples  FOR02-01CAR,  FOR05-02CAR,  FOR06-02CAR,  FOR08-01CAR,  FOR09-01CAR,  and  FOR11-01CAR. The  characteristics of the selected samples are presented in Table 3.1. || However,  laterites derived from weathering of basic or ultra-basic rocks, or host rocks that are enriched in iron,  such as iron-rich shales and siltstones, may be sufficiently rich in iron (and/or other elements such as  nickel) to be minable. This is the case in the Dem study area, where iron-rich laterite overlies iron-rich  shale host rocks of the Birimian Supergroup. In  contrast  to  laterite,  ferricrete  is  the  iron-cemented  duricrust  that  is  formed  by  various  processes  particularly  pedogenesis  (McFarlane,  1976). Generally  it  overlies  the  laterite  profile  in  Burkina  Faso  but  is  still  regarded  as  part  of  the  laterite  weathering  profile  (Schwartz,  1994). The  mineralogy of ferricrete is typically composed of goethite, limonite, lepicrocite, hematite in varying  proportions,  sometimes  with  minor  amounts  of  manganese  oxides,  and  residual  base  metal  sulfides  (Craig  and  Vaughan,  1994). The  profile  typically  presents  indurated  strata  rich  in  kaolinite  and  hematite (Nahon and Tardy, 1992). || In the study area a considerable amount of  crushed  quartz  and  outcrops  of  quartz  veins  occurs  both  in  the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are  carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. It is possible that quartz  was the main flux, but further study is needed to clarify this aspect of iron ore production at Dem. An important aspect of the greater mining footprint of the Dem ASM site are the many tracks,  which stand proud in the eroding fossil aeolian landscape. Tracks in desert aeolian sands are difficult  to  eradicate  and  can  remain  for  decades  as  trace  fossils  as  evidenced  from  rehabilitation  programs  around  the  world  which  want to  remove  tire and track  damage  in  deserts  (Burke  and  Cloete,  2004;  Wassenaar et al., 2013). In the Dem study area, tracks are pressed into the fossil alluvial soil (that is  currently being eroded) and these lead from mine to furnaces and processing sites, and from the east  of  the  mine  site  region  where  the  historic  Dem  forest  is  speculated  to  have  been  situated,  to  the  furnaces. || Slag was dumped near the smelting sites (furnaces) and also close to  the ore sources. The layout of the Dem ASM site is presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The  host  rocks  to  the  iron  ore  deposits  included  metamorphosed  shale,  siltstone,  low  grade  laterite-ferricrete  and  mineralised  quartz  cataclasite  veins. At least  one  mine  site,  the  host  rock  was  mangacrete. 4.2. Ore body  The Dem study area is situated in the Goren greenstone belt and hosted in rocks of the Birimian  Supergroup (Hein et al., 2004; Hein 2010). || The  Dem  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  (GGB)  which  comprises  meta- volcanic  and  pyroclastic  units  that  are  interbedded  with  meta-sedimentary  rocks  (Hein  et  al.,  2004;  2010). Carbonaceous  manganese-rich  shale  beds  and  tholeiitic  dacitic  rocks  are  interbedded  with  volcanic units (Kříbek et al., 2008). Based  on  a  reconnaissance  geological  survey  conducted  in  November-December  2010,  the  Dem  region  consists  of  metamorphosed  basalt,  siltstone,  iron  formations  and  shale  units  that  are  unconformably  overlain  by  a  10  m  thick  silcrete-laterite-ferricrete  duricrust. The  Dem  mine  site  is  hosted  in  shale  and  manganiferous  ironstone  units. An  iron-rich  laterite-ferricrete  duricrust  formed  during the Cretaceous and Miocene (Dequincey et al., 2006) and is a local source of iron ore. 1.4. || and accessory plagioclase (Figure 5.1b). The siltstone and shale units are graphitic and carbonaceous  and sometimes manganiferous. The  basalt-andesite  units  in  the  Dem  study  area  are  generally  massive,  and  sometimes  amygdaloidal. They  are  strongly  to  weakly  altered  and  typically  chloritized. They  are  composed  of  fine to very fine assemblage of plagioclase, clinopyroxene (altered to chlorite), and biotite altered to  chlorite (Figure 5.1c). Quartz and rarely carbonate fills vugs as amygdules. || resources (iron ore, charcoal, clay, water and flux), (2) the choice of trees for making charcoal and  transporting them to the processing site, (3) clay collection for furnace construction and production of  tuyere  and  crucibles,  and  (4)  distribution  of  the  final  product  after  smelting. Presumably,  historic  smelters  could  possibly  choose  the  smelting  site  near  at  least  one  resource. Certainly,  the  iron-rich  resources  at  Dem  gave  reason  for  the  other  industries  to  exist;  tuyere,  crucible  and  furnace  brick  production is interpreted to have taken place locally from orange aeolian sand which covers the Dem  study area. Charcoal was the most appropriate fuel for the smelting of iron ore in ancient times but the type  of  wood  used  in  the  Dem  study  area  is  a  subject  of  speculation. Charcoal  is  a  by-product  of  dry  distillation  of  wood  and  contains  high  carbon  content  (Karbowniczek,  2005). It  is  advantageous  because it is easy to produce, has low ash content, contains no sulphur and has a high caloric value  meaning, it can maintain very high temperatures in a small volume (Craddock, 1995).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Netherlands<br><b>Pages:</b> 18,20,28,33,35,40,50,53<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  characteristics  of  slag  such  as  the  volume,  density,  porosity  and  grain  size  is  influenced  by  the  cooling  rate,  temperature  and  the  chemical  composition  of  the  iron  ore,  flux,  charcoal and clay. Higher temperatures decrease the viscosity of the melt. Different  types  of  slag  (Figure  4.7)  were  dumped  at  different  locations  in  the  Dem  area  and  included (1) a dense black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy  type resembling an obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a  spinifex-like texture due to quenching at high temperature, and (4) a clay containing pumice-like slag  with vugs that formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. Due to high silica content of the slag, it is resistant to weathering, thus large amounts of slag  fragments  were  found  at  the  ASM  site.

They  correspond  with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the  first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages  of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period  1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant  centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated  in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao.

Figure  1.3:  Photographs  of  the  elders  of  the  village  of  Liligomde  who  provided  the  ethnographic  background to this study (a, b, e). Their information indicated that no artisanal mining for iron  had taken place at Dem in their lifetimes. The senior elders ranged in age from 75-104 and they  were  the  senior  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. || Slag was dumped near the smelting sites (furnaces) and also close to  the ore sources. The layout of the Dem ASM site is presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The  host  rocks  to  the  iron  ore  deposits  included  metamorphosed  shale,  siltstone,  low  grade  laterite-ferricrete  and  mineralised  quartz  cataclasite  veins. At least  one  mine  site,  the  host  rock  was  mangacrete. 4.2. Ore body  The Dem study area is situated in the Goren greenstone belt and hosted in rocks of the Birimian  Supergroup (Hein et al., 2004; Hein 2010). || The  Dem  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  (GGB)  which  comprises  meta- volcanic  and  pyroclastic  units  that  are  interbedded  with  meta-sedimentary  rocks  (Hein  et  al.,  2004;  2010). Carbonaceous  manganese-rich  shale  beds  and  tholeiitic  dacitic  rocks  are  interbedded  with  volcanic units (Kříbek et al., 2008). Based  on  a  reconnaissance  geological  survey  conducted  in  November-December  2010,  the  Dem  region  consists  of  metamorphosed  basalt,  siltstone,  iron  formations  and  shale  units  that  are  unconformably  overlain  by  a  10  m  thick  silcrete-laterite-ferricrete  duricrust. The  Dem  mine  site  is  hosted  in  shale  and  manganiferous  ironstone  units. An  iron-rich  laterite-ferricrete  duricrust  formed  during the Cretaceous and Miocene (Dequincey et al., 2006) and is a local source of iron ore. 1.4. || The  volcano-sedimentary  formation  in  the  northeast  portion  of  the  WAC  contains  stratiform  deposits  of  iron-rich  shale,  manganese  and  manganese-iron-carbonate  deposits  particularly  in  the  northeast  of  Burkina  Faso  at  Tambão  (Kimberly,  1989;  Beauvais  et  al.,  2008)  and  Billiata  (Tshibubudze and Hein, 2013). Manganiferous iron ore deposits are formed by the leaching of silica,  carbon dioxide, magnesia and minor amounts of other constituents. In addition, some manganiferous  deposits  are  formed  by  the  local  migration  of  iron  and  manganese  that  produced  space  filling  and  replacement  of  silica. Manganese  iron  ore  deposits  are  formed  on  the  seafloor  and  build-up  as  chemical sediments together with additional sedimentary or volcanic detritus (Dasgupta et al., 1999;  Mücke, 2005 suggesting that perhaps the formation of the iron and manganese deposits is related to  seafloor exhalite processes. In  the  Goren  greenstone  belt,  in  which  the  Dem  site  is  located,  Fe-rich  siltstone  shale  and  siltstone  are  sometimes  manganiferous  and  intercalated  with  volcaniclastic  meta-greywacke,  meta- siltstone with minor resedimented pyroclastic deposits (Peters and Hein, 2013). However, repetitious  successions  of  Fe-rich  low  grade  metamorphosed  siltstones,  fine-grained,  carbonaceous,  Fe-rich  exhalative and volcaniclastic units are typically intercalated with the basalt units. || tradition of significant elders of the Mossi people. The Dem site is thus an archaeological curiosity  and may provide a link with the historic mining history of the people of West Africa.

Across  the  West  African  Craton,  an  extensive  laterite-ferricrete  plateau  is  locally  mined  as  a  source for iron ore for the agricultural industry (Figure 4.2), such as near the village of Liligomde near  Kaya). In  the  Dem  region,  ferricrete  overlying  iron-rich  shale  was  clearly  mined  artisanally  as  a  source  of  iron,  along  with  primary  iron  in  the  alteration  selvages  around  buck  quartz  veins  that  crosscut the iron-rich shale.

When the ore is  smelted, those things which were  mixed with the metal before it was melted are driven forth, because the metal is perfected by  fire in this manner. Since metalliferous ores differ greatly amongst themselves, first as to the  metals which they contain, then as to the quantity of the metal which is in them, and then by the  fact that some are rapidly melted by fire and others slowly, there are, therefore, many methods  of smelting.” (Agricola, 1556)  Figure 1.1: Photograph of a typical modern day artisanal forge that is operated by one man, with a  single pump and a number of small crucibles.

Petrographic  and  mineralogical  studies:  selected  samples  of  the  lithologies,  host  rocks,  ore  body and slag were investigated to establish the lithological type and slag characteristics. The list  of selected samples for petrography is given in Appendix 3. Carbon isotopes and AMS radiocarbon dating: A total of six carbon samples were dated using  radiometric  and  accelerator  mass  spectrometry  (AMS)  at  Beta  Analytic  Laboratories  in  Miami,  Florida, USA. 3.2. Ethnographic research  This  study  used  ethnographic  methods  and  research  as  a  first  pass  to  establish  the  history  of  artisanal  mining  of  iron  in  the  Kaya  region,  and  specifically  the  Dem  region. || It can thus be reasonably interpreted that the Dem site predates modern iron making in the Kaya  region. Radiocarbon  dates  given  for  the  last  80  years  were  thus  discounted. The  age  of  mining,  processing and production is thus tentatively constrained by radiocarbon dating to have been active in  1438-1458 AD, 1600-1651 AD, or 1756-1759 AD. Iron was initially forged in West Africa as early as the 6th century (Insoll, 1997; Pleiner, 2000)  and iron smelting was practiced in the southeast of Burkina Faso by the Bura  culture whose culture  was focused in the region 250 km southeast of Dem. Iron forging and smelting was thus known to the  peoples of West Africa. By the 15th century, forging and smelting of iron (and gold) where central to  the region and particularly, the Songhay economy which dominated trade in the region. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Kaya, Sanmatenga, Central-North, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 30,33,67<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Location of the town  of Dem along the main road to Kaya is shown. Sites of Opencast (OC) mining, underground (UG) mines and  forges/ furnaces are also presented. The mine site is wholly located east of the major ridge on an alluvial plain. Lac Dem is located east of the town of Dem. 31 || Lac  Dem  is  located  east  of  the  town  of  Dem. Figure 3.2: Geology and layout of the Dem site. Open cast mines 1-3 are located on the eastern side  of  a  ridge  of  ferricrete  duricrust  and  immediately  east  of  ferricrete  scree  in  Fe-Mn  rich  metasedimentary rocks, and adit to UG 1-2 underground mines is located above the open casts. Forges/Furnaces  1-11  are  situated  on  the  alluvium  plain  blow  the  open  cast  mines. Waste  dumps are situated proximal to the furnace sites. Figure 4.1: Photographs of vein-hosted iron ore from adits in the underground mines of the Dem iron  site. || The ore was dominantly composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3), with impurities of  SiO2,  as  occurs  in  many  ancient  iron  and  copper  sites  that  produce  an  iron  silicate  slag  of  low  temperature  (1200°C)  slag  (Craddock  and  Meeks,  1987). The  magnetite-hematite  rich  veins  were  structurally controlled in the host rocks. Lateritic ore also provided a second source of iron-rich rock  for mining at the Dem site. Processing  sites  comprised  at  least  11  furnaces  that  were  dome  and  circular  in  shape. The  furnaces were filled with crucibles and tuyeres made of clay sand perhaps sourced  locally from the  alluvial plain  on  which  the  furnaces are  situated  or the  Dem  Valley  which is  now  occupied  by  Lac  Dem (Figures 3.1; 3.2). Crucibles and tuyeres litter the furnace sites as waste or are welded together  with  slag  in  the  base  of  the  furnace  structure. || Waste  areas  are  situated  adjacent  to  most  furnaces  suggesting a modest level of industrial activity ranging from mining or ore, processing and cleaning,  building  of  furnaces,  making  of  crucibles  and  tuyeres,  and  processing  the  slag  after  smelting. The  presence of at least 11 furnaces with significant mining and processing of ore  suggests that the Dem  site may have been an important historic iron producing region. A source of fuel remains speculative but the location of the mine site adjacent to the Lac Dem,  which  historically  was  a  wooden  valley  prior  to  the  damming  of  the  lake,  may  have  meant  that  a  source of fuel in the form of timber was readily available. In any case, timber for charcoal may have  been  transported  to  the  site  in  the  same  way  that  timber  for  charcoal  is  transported  to  the  growing  urban centres nearby from the forest surrounding the region (Kramer, 2002; Ouedraogo et al., 2010). A source of flux may have the carbonaceous rocks and quartz that form part of the host rocks of  the region, or waste rock to the iron ore. A source of clean limestone which would make an ideal flux  does not occur in the region according to regional maps of Hottin and Ouedraogo (1992), Hein et al.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Lake Dem, Zorkoum, Sanmatenga, Central-North, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 31,66,9<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Iron rich spongy ferricrete is used for smelting (d) which makes tools for local agricultural use. The  elderly  gentleman  in  (e)  made  his  own  gun  from  smelting  local  iron. Photographs  are  reproduced  with  permission  of  the  village  elders. (f)  Ethnographic  data  was  collected  by  interview  and  data  was  recorded  in  a  notebook  with  translations  from  Mossi  to  French  and  English as facilitated by Mr Bamogo Makido of the Museum of Kaya (squatting). Figure 2.1: Schematic of furnace, showing temperatures and reactions during smelting (Cleere. || Importantly, although the Museum of Kaya has a single ASM furnace on display to preserve  the techniques  of  iron  forging,  the  museum  indicated  that  no  research has ever  been  undertaken  on  iron  mining,  processing  and  production  anywhere  in  Burkina  Faso  and  certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. With this in mind, this study focuses on the historic mining, processing and production of iron  ore in the Dem region of Burkina Faso. Because the history is arguably lost, the techniques are not  known, the reasons for production are forgotten and the age of mine workings is no longer known,  this  study  records  the  size  and  dimensions  of  the  mine  sites,  waste  sites,  orebody  and  furnaces. It  records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the  processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings  in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and  could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century. || LIST OF FIGURES  Frontispiece “Wherefore smelting is necessary, for by this means earths, solidified juices, and stones  are separated from the metals so that they obtain their proper colour and become pure, and may  be of great use to mankind in many ways. When the ore is  smelted, those things which were  mixed with the metal before it was melted are driven forth, because the metal is perfected by  fire in this manner. Since metalliferous ores differ greatly amongst themselves, first as to the  metals which they contain, then as to the quantity of the metal which is in them, and then by the  fact that some are rapidly melted by fire and others slowly, there are, therefore, many methods  of smelting.” (Agricola, 1556)  Figure 1.1: Photograph of a typical modern day artisanal forge that is operated by one man, with a  single pump and a number of small crucibles. The tuyere is clearly visible. A goat skin bellows  would  have  been  placed  over  the  bellows  hole  to  pump  air  into  the  tuyere. This  particular  working forge is on exhibition at the Museum of Kaya and is presented with the permission of  the Museum. || The  recording  of  ethnographic  data  was  considered  important  to  develop  a  base  historical  perspective  and  perhaps  constrain the age of activity at the iron artisan mine site. Interviews with significant elders (Fig 1.3) of  the Mossi peoples where arranged with the assistance of staff from the Museum of Kaya. 30 || The  slower  cooled  slag  exhibits  phaneritic  texture with crystals that are large in size (c.f., Craddock and Meeks, 1987; van Oss, 2002). The fast  cooling rate exhibits an aphanitic texture wherein the slag will have small crystals with vesicles. The  rapid  cooling  rate  produced  a  granular  or  glassy  texture  with  very  fine  crystals  that  resemble  the  volcanic rock obsidian (c.f., van Oss, 2002; Stewart, 2007). Ethnographic research indicated that ASM of iron ore from the Dem site did not take place in  the  last  80  years  or  1932-2012. Additionally,  the  Museum  of  Kaya  and  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso  does  not record iron  workings  at  Dem  over  the  last  hundred  years. There  are  also  no  other historic records of iron making at Dem. || The  tuyere  is  clearly  visible.

This particular working forge is on exhibition at the  Museum of Kaya and is presented with the permission of the Museum. The Dem region is situated 17 km north-northwest of the town of Kaya in Burkina Faso (Figure  1.2). Burkina  Faso’s  rural  economy  is  dependent  on  agriculture,  and  seasonal  artisanal  small  and  medium-scale  mining  (ASM)  for  livelihoods. According  to  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso  there have been no studies of ASM for iron in Burkina Faso, and there are no records of iron mining  and processing for the Dem region. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Zubir Said Drive, Orchard Road, Museum, Central, Singapore, 229233, Singapore<br><b>Pages:</b> 15,18,30,33,67,8<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Large amounts of iron were smelted in the Nile Valley. Iron reached eastern Africa by 200 BC,  and by 200 AD had been carried to the south by ancestors of the modern Bantu peoples, together with  farming. However, the age of iron in the Dem region is not known and establishing its age may be  important to the mining history and heritage of the African continent.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Nile Brook, Margaree Valley, Municipality of the County of Inverness, Inverness County, Nova Scotia, Canada<br><b>Pages:</b> 18<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

This  is  case  for  the  Faléme  iron  ore  deposits  which  are  the  largest  Palaeoproterozoic  iron  ore  deposits  in  the  WAC  (Combes,  1980;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). They  are  spatially associated with hydrothermal mineralisation associated with tourmalinisation, carbonisation,  chloritisation and albitisation of the host metasedimentary and volcanic rocks (Bassot, 1997). Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  Tin  Edia  deposit  of  the  Oudalan  province  in  Burkina  Faso  (Neyberg  et  al.,  1980). The  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  veins  which  crosscut  gabbro,  gabbro- norite  and  norite  intrusions  as  magnetite  and  ilmenite,  with  accessory  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite  and  arsenopyrite  (Castaing  et  al.,  2003). Iron-titanium  ores  mostly  consist  of  titaniferous-magnetite  in  association with ulvospinel and ilmenite. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Pétabarabé Oudalan, Falagountou, Séno, Sahel, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 29,33<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Manganiferous iron ore deposits are formed by the leaching of silica,  carbon dioxide, magnesia and minor amounts of other constituents. In addition, some manganiferous  deposits  are  formed  by  the  local  migration  of  iron  and  manganese  that  produced  space  filling  and  replacement  of  silica. Manganese  iron  ore  deposits  are  formed  on  the  seafloor  and  build-up  as  chemical sediments together with additional sedimentary or volcanic detritus (Dasgupta et al., 1999;  Mücke, 2005 suggesting that perhaps the formation of the iron and manganese deposits is related to  seafloor exhalite processes.

They  correspond  with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the  first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages  of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period  1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant  centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated  in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao.

In fact, ferricrete may  overlie  one,  or  more  of  three  gently  inclined  laterite  pediments  that  formed  as  erosional  surfaces  between 45 Ma and 2 Ma (Beauvais et al., 2008). 2.4. Iron ore deposits in the WAC  The WAC hosts iron ore reserves that are hosted in large Palaeoproterozoic BIF (banded iron  formation) deposits (>6000  mt) of iron ore in the Man and Reguibat shields (Bronner et al., 1990). The BIF in greenstone belts are also a local source of iron (Milési et al., 1989). BIF's  are  fine  bedded  chemical  sedimentary  rocks  composed  of  chert  (amorphous  silica)  and  iron-bearing minerals with an iron content of greater than 30 wt% (USGS, 2000). || Some BIF deposits are formed from metal-rich brines that are expelled at active rift zones by  hydrothermal  activity. This  is  case  for  the  Faléme  iron  ore  deposits  which  are  the  largest  Palaeoproterozoic  iron  ore  deposits  in  the  WAC  (Combes,  1980;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). They  are  spatially associated with hydrothermal mineralisation associated with tourmalinisation, carbonisation,  chloritisation and albitisation of the host metasedimentary and volcanic rocks (Bassot, 1997). Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  Tin  Edia  deposit  of  the  Oudalan  province  in  Burkina  Faso  (Neyberg  et  al.,  1980). The  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  veins  which  crosscut  gabbro,  gabbro- norite  and  norite  intrusions  as  magnetite  and  ilmenite,  with  accessory  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite  and  arsenopyrite  (Castaing  et  al.,  2003).

The decline was followed by slavery with British  and  French  colonials  battling  for  control  over  coastal  ports. Europeans  conflicted  over  land  throughout  West  African  countries  and  brought  slave  trade  into  Fulani  and  Wassoulou  Empire  (Swartz,  1980). In  1756-1759,  from  one-  to  two-thirds  of  the  whole  population  of  the  Fulani  jihad  states  comprised  enslaved  people. This  period  was  followed  by  the  colonial  period  that  took  place  from 1895-1958 and French colonials took control over West Africa. 65 || Interestingly,  although  quite  limited  in  number,  the  ages  correspond  broadly  with  the  rapid  expansion  of  iron  technology  from  1400-1600  AD  in  West  Africa  (Todd,  1979). They  correspond  with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the  first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages  of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period  1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant  centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated  in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao. These  towns  are  respectively  situated  360  km  west,  450  km  north- northwest and 370 km northeast of Dem across the international border of present day Burkina Faso  and Mali. || It can thus be reasonably interpreted that the Dem site predates modern iron making in the Kaya  region. Radiocarbon  dates  given  for  the  last  80  years  were  thus  discounted. The  age  of  mining,  processing and production is thus tentatively constrained by radiocarbon dating to have been active in  1438-1458 AD, 1600-1651 AD, or 1756-1759 AD. Iron was initially forged in West Africa as early as the 6th century (Insoll, 1997; Pleiner, 2000)  and iron smelting was practiced in the southeast of Burkina Faso by the Bura  culture whose culture  was focused in the region 250 km southeast of Dem. Iron forging and smelting was thus known to the  peoples of West Africa. By the 15th century, forging and smelting of iron (and gold) where central to  the region and particularly, the Songhay economy which dominated trade in the region. || Kribek,  B.,  Syrokorova,  I.,  Machovic,  V.,  Laufek,  F.,  2008.

Location and physiography  The Dem study area is located in the Sanmatenga District of northeast Burkina Faso. Burkina  Faso is a landlocked country that covers 274 300 km2 (Bierschenk, 1968) and shares its borders with  Mali, Togo, Benin, Ghana, Niger and Côte d’Ivoire. The capital city is Ouagadougou and is located in  the  geographic  centre  of  the  country. The  average  daily  temperature  is  recorded  as  32°C  and  the  average annual rainfall is less than 25 centimetres in the north and northeast (McFarland et al., 1998). Vegetation in Burkina Faso is predominantly sparse savannah grasslands, dry forest with occasional  18 || According to Pryce et al. (2010), laterites  result from the decomposition of rock within a dynamic leaching environment. Beauvais  et  al. (2008)  stated  that  most  laterite  deposits  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso  were  formed  by  long-term  meteoric  weathering. Formation  probably  took  place  in  a  tectonically  stable,  slowly  eroding,  tropical  environment  (Brown  et  al.,  1994;  10Be  and26Al  isotopic  depletion  ratios  of  ferricrete)  in  the  Cretaceous  period  and  during  breakup  of  Gondwanaland,  with  reworking  of  the  laterite  during  the  Miocene-Eocene  (Beauvais  et  al.,  2008;  Beauvais  and  Chardon,  2013;  WAXI,  2013). Although Burkina Faso is currently in a sub-tropical to Sahelian climatic zone, geographically  it was positioned in a tropical climatic zone during the Cretaceous when the equator was located just  27 || Interestingly,  although  quite  limited  in  number,  the  ages  correspond  broadly  with  the  rapid  expansion  of  iron  technology  from  1400-1600  AD  in  West  Africa  (Todd,  1979). They  correspond  with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the  first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages  of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period  1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant  centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated  in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao. These  towns  are  respectively  situated  360  km  west,  450  km  north- northwest and 370 km northeast of Dem across the international border of present day Burkina Faso  and Mali. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 18,27,33,64<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Manganiferous iron ore deposits are formed by the leaching of silica,  carbon dioxide, magnesia and minor amounts of other constituents. In addition, some manganiferous  deposits  are  formed  by  the  local  migration  of  iron  and  manganese  that  produced  space  filling  and  replacement  of  silica. Manganese  iron  ore  deposits  are  formed  on  the  seafloor  and  build-up  as  chemical sediments together with additional sedimentary or volcanic detritus (Dasgupta et al., 1999;  Mücke, 2005 suggesting that perhaps the formation of the iron and manganese deposits is related to  seafloor exhalite processes. In  the  Goren  greenstone  belt,  in  which  the  Dem  site  is  located,  Fe-rich  siltstone  shale  and  siltstone  are  sometimes  manganiferous  and  intercalated  with  volcaniclastic  meta-greywacke,  meta- siltstone with minor resedimented pyroclastic deposits (Peters and Hein, 2013).

According to Taylor et al. (2001), laterite is a regolith mass that is cemented by Fe-oxides, with  composition that is characterised by SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, H2O and accessory elements, including Cr,  V,  Zr  and  Ti. However,  laterites  exhibit  a  vertical  zonality  of  their  characteristics  and  components  (Blot,  2004)  but  are  typically  a  weathering  profile  consisting  of  some,  or  all  of  the  soil  profile,  ferruginous  crust  and  bedrock. Laterites  in  the  northeast  of  Burkina  Faso  are  similar  but  some  are  developed from weathering of tuffaceous schist and calc-alkaline granites (Brown et al., 1994). In general, iron laterites are low in iron and not of economic interest (Read, 1937).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 28,29<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

In the southeast part of Burkina Faso and southwest of  Niger, the Iron Age civilizations were demonstrated by the Bura culture that practiced smelting and  forging of tools and weapons in 1200 AD (Miller et al., 1994). Charcoal  was  a  primary  fuel  in  sub-Saharan  Africa  for  smelting,  and  successful  smelting  required resilient woods that would burn slowly at high temperature (Childs, 1991). Ore preparation  involved picking of the leanest ores followed by washing and crushing to remove the matrix and gross  impurities  (Kense,  1983).

The  vegetation at the valley is presently dominated by large trees and savannah forest. It seems possible  that the historic Dem forest could  have provided the source of fuel (charcoal) during iron smelting,  and perhaps a ready source of water. A source of flux is also important in iron ore production. Flux is used as a reducing agent that  facilitates  the  chemical  reaction  and  separates  the  molten  metal  from  the  waste  (slag)  in  smelting. Some fluxes used in smelting include carbonate and quartz. || The ore might have been man-hauled to  the surface in bags or sacks particularly because there is no evidence at the Dem site of mechanical  aids for hoisting and hauling ore. It is possible that the open cast operations were mined by women,  children  and  aged  persons,  as  can  be  witnessed  at  ASM  sites  throughout  Burkina  Faso  and  West  Africa, with the underground operations being the domain of men. Different  types  of  slag  were  dumped  proximal  to  the  furnace  sites  and  included  (1)  a  dense  black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy type resembling an  obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a spinifex-like texture  due  to  quenching  at  high  temperature,  and  (4)  a  clay  containing  pumice-like  slag  with  vugs  that  formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. A considerable amount of clean crushed quartz and outcrops of quartz veins occurs both in the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally,  which  may  have  been  used  as  a  flux  in  the  smelting  process. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are  carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. At Dem, an immediate source of charcoal could have been from the valleys to the east of the  ASM site which today hosts dams for irrigation and extensive market gardens.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Embassy of the United States, Mohammed Bin Asim Street, Al Rayyan, Qatar<br><b>Pages:</b> 50,68<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

In  Burkina  Faso  approximately  95  kms  northeast  of  the  capital  city  Ouagadougou  near  the  village  of  Dem  and  on  a  ferricrete  capped  ridge  to  the  west  of  the  village,  it  is  possible  to  find  a  number  of  opencast workings and underground mines that show evidence of extensive artisanal mining for iron. Iron mining worked quartz-vein hosted and lateritic ore. Nearby, waste piles, processing sites and at  least  eleven  (11)  Bloomery  furnaces  are  exposed  on  the  alluvial  plain. Petrographically  the  ore  bearing  rocks  consist  of  goethite-hematite  as  the  dominant  oxides  with  silica. Geological  and  ethnographic  studies  conducted  in  2011  focussed  on  detailing  and  mapping  the  mine  site  and  host  rocks  (including  ore  rocks),  and  establishing  the  age  of  mining,  processing  and  forging  of  ore. || Figure 1.2: Location of the study area in Burkina Faso, northeast of the capital city of Ouagadougou  and 17 km northwest of the regional centre of Kaya.

Consequently,  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. || Figure 1.3: Photographs of the elders of the village of Liligomde who provided the ethnographic background to  this study (a, b, e).

Consequently,  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. Artisanal mining for iron is conducted west of the village of Liligomde (c) with smelting in the village on small  crucibles. Iron rich spongy ferricrete is used for smelting (d) which makes tools for local agricultural use. || Quartz vein cataclasite veins surrounded by a wide alteration zone  of iron enriched siltstone. D. A complex zone of alteration in massive siltstone. Across  the  West  African  Craton,  an  extensive  laterite-ferricrete  plateau  is  locally  mined  as  a  source for iron ore for the agricultural industry (Figure 4.2), such as near the village of Liligomde near  Kaya). In  the  Dem  region,  ferricrete  overlying  iron-rich  shale  was  clearly  mined  artisanally  as  a  source  of  iron,  along  with  primary  iron  in  the  alteration  selvages  around  buck  quartz  veins  that  crosscut the iron-rich shale. Laterite-ferricrete type iron ores are derived from the sub-aerial alteration of rocks (Beukes et  al., 2002). || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known  but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not  been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly  not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of  Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the  Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the  Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through  the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon  people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion  et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the  Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths,  or before 1920-1930 AD.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Liligomde, Yatenga, North, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 15,17,33,41,8<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
