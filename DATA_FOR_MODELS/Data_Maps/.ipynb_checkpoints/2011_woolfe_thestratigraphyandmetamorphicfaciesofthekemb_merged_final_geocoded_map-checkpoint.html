Introduction  1.1 Preamble  The  Kel  Enguef  metamorphic  belt  (KEMB)  is  located  in  the  low  hills  southeast  of  Gorom  Gorom, in the northeast of Burkina Faso. It is named after the village of Kel Enguef which is  situated  in  the  east  of  the  field  area. During  field  reconnaissance  in  2010,  the  KEMB  was  found by the Wits research team where it presented an anomaly on the regional topographical  and geological maps. The KEMB has not been researched in detail, thus how it fits in with  the  surrounding  area  is  unknown. The  general  region  of  the  KEMB  has  been  mapped  by  Castaing et al. || STUDY AREA  a. Road to Markoye  N  Kel Enguef  Kel Enguef metamorphic belt  1 km  b.

Indicated  on the image is the location of Kel Enguef and the main roads in the area. (Google Earth)  4 || The  field  area,  which  is  approximately  30km2,  hosts  two  east-west  trending  ridges  that  expose a portion of the KEMB  (Fig. 1.1b).

This region of Burkina Faso is situated in  the Sahel, just south of the Sahara Desert. Climatic conditions are arid, that is very hot and  dry.

The  terrain has been subjected to a series of regional tectonic events. The studies of Tshibubudze  et al. (2009) and Tshibubudze and Hein (submitted) have indicated that the KEMB lies west  of    the  Markoye  Shear  Zone  which  developed  by  at  least  two  regional  deformation  events. Understanding the tectonic history of the KEMB is beyond the scope of this project however  based on the metamorphic and structural data collected, a simplified tectonic history can be  suggested. Saying this, further studies will be crucial in acquiring a greater understanding of  how the KEMB fits in with the regional geology. || The  Essakane  gold  mine  and  Tambão  manganese  deposit  are  situated  approximately  20km ESE and 40km NNE of the field area, respectively, and similar styles of mineralisation  may occur in the field area. 1.2 Location and physiography  The KEMB is located in the northeast of Burkina Faso, approximately 275km to the northeast  of Ouagadougou and east of the town of Gorom Gorom (Fig. 1.1a & 1.1b). 3 || The craton has been subjected to several tectonic events corresponding to the deformation of  Birimian  Supergroup. This  includes  the  SW  directed  shortening  of  the  Tangaean  Event  (2170-2130  Ma),  SE-NW  shortening  of  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (2130-1980  Ma)  and  the  young Wabo-Tampelse Event. The Tangaean Event and Eburnean Orogeny were associated  with emplacement of TTG-suite plutons and dykes (Feybesse et al., 2006; Tshibubudze et al.,  2009; Hein 2010). The tectonic events resulted in the formation of greenstone belts separated  by  the  granitoids  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002). The  Eburnean  Orogeny  resulted  in  regional  metamorphism of the Birimian Supergroup to greenschist facies and contact metamorphism  from pluton emplacement to low - medium amphibolite facies (Pons et al., 1995; Debat et al.,  2003). 2.2 Local geology  The  Markoye  Shear  Zone  lies  to  the  east  of  the  KEMB. || The intrusion of the diorite pluton. There are several granodiorite plutons that occur in  the  surrounding  area  (Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  submitted). The  most  likely  source  of  the pluton in KEMB could be a  younger batholith related diorite intrusions south of  the town of Gorom Gorom. 7. The  formation  of  the  ferricrete  horizons  followed  by  the  tertiary  sands. Ferricrete  horizons  in  the  WAC  formed  during  the  Cretaceous  and  associated  with  the  development of in situ laterite (Brown et al., 1994; Burke and Gunnell, 2008). || Therefore  the  sequences  described  may  represent a portion of the Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt and this would also be enforced  by the KEMB close proximity to the belt, to east of the Markoye shear zone,  41 || These zones of infiltration would have  had  to  be  concentrated  and  localised. The  rapid  increase  of  temperature  in  pre-existing  hot  conditions could have induced partial melting and dehydration of the rock. Migmatites from  Saint-Malo, France, with a very similar mineral assemblage of muscovite-plagioclase-quartz  leucosome and biotite-rich melanosome, are interpreted to have formed by the breakdown of  muscovite (Sawyer, 2008). Although the Saint-Malo migmatites have been proposed to have  formed  in  upper  amphibolite  facies,  the  presence  of  muscovite  in  the  metamorphosed  rock  which formed the migmatite in KEMB would have been a source for more hydrous fluid. 46<br><b>Geocode:</b> Kembach, Wertheim, Main-Tauber-Kreis, Baden-Württemberg, 97277, Germany<br><b>Pages:</b> 4,42,47,48,49,8<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Petrography  The petrographic study included 16 thin section samples of the Kel Enguef metamorphic belt. These  were  chosen  as  representative  samples  of  the  stratigraphy. The  focus  of  the  petrographic study was on the textural features and mineral assemblages in order to establish  the original rock types and the conditions which lead to metamorphism of the metamorphic  samples. The study splits the samples into the various facies. Intrusive samples focus on the  mineralogy. || Abstract  The  Kel  Enguef  metamorphic  belt  is  host  to  metamorphosed  clastic  and  chemical  sedimentary  rocks  that  are  intruded  by  gabbro  dykes  and  a  diorite  pluton. The  metamorphosed  clastic  and  sedimentary  rocks  were  deposited  in  a  deltaic  setting  into  a  shallow  marine  environment. The  sequences  comprise  fine-  to  coarse-grained  sedimentary  rocks  that  exhibit  an  overall  upward  coarsening  stratigraphy. The  metamorphism  and  deformation of the sequences is interpreted to have occurred mainly as a result of burial. Both  greenschist and amphibolite grade metamorphism have been recognised. Gradation between  these two facies is not observed. || STUDY AREA  a. Road to Markoye  N  Kel Enguef  Kel Enguef metamorphic belt  1 km  b.

The Birimian Supergroup is dominated by metamorphosed sedimentary, volcano-sedimentary  and  volcanic  sequences.

Introduction  1.1 Preamble  The  Kel  Enguef  metamorphic  belt  (KEMB)  is  located  in  the  low  hills  southeast  of  Gorom  Gorom, in the northeast of Burkina Faso. It is named after the village of Kel Enguef which is  situated  in  the  east  of  the  field  area. During  field  reconnaissance  in  2010,  the  KEMB  was  found by the Wits research team where it presented an anomaly on the regional topographical  and geological maps. The KEMB has not been researched in detail, thus how it fits in with  the  surrounding  area  is  unknown. The  general  region  of  the  KEMB  has  been  mapped  by  Castaing et al. || River  channels  trend  east  towards  a  major  river that is located on the eastern limits of the field area. The majority of the land between  the ridges is covered by millet fields where the underlying rock is covered by a layer of sand. Huts  are  scatted  across  the  farm  land  with  the  village  of  Kel  Enguef  situated  to  the  east  between  the  two  ridges  of  the  field  area  (Fig. 1.1b). Dirt  roads  are  present  connecting  the  village of Kel Enguef to the main road off to the west of the field area. Access into the field  was either from this main road or from the north off a main road that connects Gorom Gorom  to the village of Markoye (Fig.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Kel Enguef, Téra, Tillabéri Region, Niger<br><b>Pages:</b> 4,6<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
