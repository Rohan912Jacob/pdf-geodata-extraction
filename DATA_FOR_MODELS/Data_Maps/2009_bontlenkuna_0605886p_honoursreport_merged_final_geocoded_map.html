The  Essakane  deposit  is  intersected  by  dolerite  dykes  and  gabbroic  sills. These  intrusive  rocks  are  composed of pyroxene and feldspar. || 4.2 Structural Features  4.2.1 Essakane  The deformation event, D1, in the Essakane deposit is recognised by the development of a NNW-NW  trending anticline (F1). The anticline is open, asymmetrical and verges to the SW (Fig. 4.4; 4.5). Due  to  poor  exposure  few  measurements  were  obtained  for  the  south-west  limb,  but  that  limited  data  suggests the limb trends NW and dips steeply SW. The north-east dipping limb is shown on the equal  area stereographic projection in Fig. 4.4, with a calculated mean of 325°/38°E. || Arsenopyrite  occurs  as  monoclinic  crystals  and  the  chalcopyrite is anhedral. The chalcopyrite forms a small proportion of the sulphides in the Essakane  samples ~1%. The arsenopyrite replaces the pyrite in these samples and occurs within the chlorite.

The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by  meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et  al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can  be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have  identified  that    quartz-vein  hosted  gold  in the  Birimian  of  West  African  craton  can  be  attributed  to  deformation in the Eburnean Orogeny (Hastings, 1982; Milési et al., 1992; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 1993;  Béziat et al., 2008). || Essakane  Plutons  Falagountou  Sokadie  30 km  Dori Batholith  Figure 6.1: Aeromagnetic photograph of the study area indicating the locations of the plutons in the area  (Photograph courtesy of A.

Taner  (2004)  recognised  a  relationship  between  the  gold  mineralisation  and  intrusions  in  the  Falagountou and Essakane deposits. The gold in these deposits can be classified as mesothermal lode  gold, thermal-aureole gold or intrusion-related gold. 1 || N  Calculated mean: 325°/38°E  NE dipping limb  n=12  Figure 4.4: Equal area stereographic projection of the Essakane bedding of NE dipping limb  1m  Figure  4.5:  Fold  axis  of  the  NW-trending  anticline  hosted  in  siltstone  in  the  Essakane  exploration  trench,  crosscut by  extensional veins (black stiples) and sheeted veins (black stiples). 21 || N  N  32km  Essakane  Falagountou  Sokadie  8km  Figure 1.2: LANDSAT image of the Oudalan-Gorouol Greenstone belt in Burkina Faso and the locations of the deposits  4 || N  δ1  Conjugate veins  Extensional veins  δ2  S1  (a)  n=6  1m  (b)  Figure  4.6:  (a)  Equal  area  stereographic  plot  of  the  conjugate  and  extensional  vein  sets  mapped  on  the  Western wall of the Essakane pit (b)    Normal –slip   Fault  Brecciated  footwall  Figure 4.7: NE-trending normal-slip fault in the exploration trench in Essakane (facing south-east).

The  interpretation  of  the  data  indicates  that  the  deposits  of  Falagountou,  Essakane  and  Sokadie  formed during the Eburnean orogeny subsequent to the intrusion and cooling of granitoid plutons. The  mineralisation  occurred  during  post  peak  metamorphism  and  is  defined  by  chloritisation  of  the  sequences. The  mineralogy  indicates  that  the  deposits  are  situated  proximal  (middle-aureole)  to  the  granitoids. The  mineralisation  is  hosted  in  quartz-carbonate-chlorite  stockwork  veins. || The calculated mean for the extensional veins and conjugate veins in Essakane  have  been  tentatively  determined  as  061°/82°S  and  164°/79°W,  respectively. Based  on  the  data  the  conjugate veins are oriented parallel to the fold axis and extensional veins are oriented perpendicular  to the fold axis, with the palaeostress was tentatively interpreted to be in NE direction. The deformation event, D2, resulted in the development of a NE- trending, normal-slip fault with a  mean direction of 300°/58° during the flexural-slip folding of the bedding and caused brecciation of  the footwall sequence (Fig. 4.8). 20 || Two of the three sites i.e. Falagountou and Sokadie are still artisanal mining sites and  Essakane is a developing mine. Essakane is the main deposit and is 11km×3km in dimension, with  Falagountou  and  Sokadie  located  to  the  East  and  south  of  the  Essakane  metasedimentary  belt,  respectively (Kerr(b), 2004). The  dominant  stratigraphic  sequences  that  have  been  identified  in  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt are a volcaniclastic greywacke sequence and an interbedded conglomerate-greywacke-siltstone- shale  sequence,  which  have  been  contact  metamorphosed  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies  during  the  emplacement  of  igneous  bodies  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). The  environment  of  deposition  is  interpreted to be a shallow marine continental shelf (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The  supracrustal  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  have  experienced  two  deformation  events  that  resulted  in  the  formation  of  shears,  folds,  mylonite  zones  and  regional  metamorphism;  contact  metamorphism  resulted  from  the  dolerite  dykes  intruding  the  area  and  the  emplacement  of  syn- and post-orogenic plutons (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). || Chapter 1  1.1 Introduction  The Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt is located in north-eastern Burkina Faso (Fig. 1.1) in the West  African  craton,  and  extends  into  the  neighbouring  Niger.

The D1 is characterised by the metasomatic alteration of  the wall rocks to form quartz vein hosted arsenopyrite-pyrite gold mineralisation and subsequent to  ׳ this  was  the  development of  vein-stockwork  mineralisation of  D2. The  V1  and V1   observed in the  Essakane deposit are interpreted to be mineralised during D1, with V2 mineralised during D2. The V2  (stockwork veins) are typical of thermal-aureole vein assemblages noted by Wall (1991). The plutons  intruding the OGGB are syn- to post Eburnean (Leube et al., 1990; Naba et al., 2004; Tshibubudze et  al.,  2009)  and  this  provides  a  time  constraint  for  the  mineralisation  of  the  deposits. A  tentative  interpretation  is  that  the  Au  mineralisation  in  these  deposits  is  post-D1;  but  is  synchronous  to  D2,  during the cooling of the granitoids. || Chapter 5: Observations  Mineralogy, Petrography and Ore petrology1  5.1 Preamble  Fifteen polished thin sections were analysed for this project, with five thin sections from each deposit. The  petrography  section  aims  to  realise  the  main  aims  and  objectives  of  the  project. In  the  thin  sections the rock types, mineralogy of the rocks, alteration types and microstructures were identified  to determine a paragenetic sequence for the gold occurring in the Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt. The dominant sulphides included arsenopyrite and pyrite, with minor sphalerite, hematite, magnetite,  chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. 5.2 Essakane  The Essakane deposit is hosted in an inclined, asymmetrical NW-NNW trending anticline. The rock  types that were identified in the thin sections are sandstone, siltstone, shale and volcaniclastics (Fig  5.1). || Figure 5.1: Drill core photographs from the Essakane deposit of (a) shale+ volcaniclastic+ siltstone   (b)  volcaniclastic with sulphides (c) siltstone (d) shale with sulphides  (Photographs courtesy of Prof Kim Hein)  27 || The Essakane deposit is described as quartz-carbonate hosted sulphide stockwork, with arsenopyrite- pyrite  gold  mineralisation  (Kerr  (b),  2004;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009),  which  formed  during  the  D2  deformation event (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Sokadie deposit is hosted in a shear zone, and it is  situated  proximally  to  the  Dori  batholith  (Kerr  (a),  2004). The  mineralisation  in  the  Falagountou  deposit  has  been  interpreted  to  be  a  stockwork  of  veinlets  of  quartz±carbonate-sulphide  (Kerr  (c),  2004). The veinlets are hosted in the metasedimentary rocks together with the intrusive rocks found in  the area (Kerr (c), 2004). 8 || These  rocks  are  constituted  by  a  number  of  minerals  that  are  common  across  the  Essakane  deposit. The  arenaceous  sedimentary  units  i.e. sandstone  and  siltstone,  are  dominated  by  common  rock  forming  minerals  i.e. quartz,  orthoclase,  plagioclase  and  biotite. The  volcaniclastic  is  made  up  of  volcanic  clasts,  quartz  and  feldspar  in  a  fine-grained  matrix. The  samples  also  record  lithological  contacts on a microscopic scale (Fig 5.2A).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Essakane, Goundam Cercle, Timbuktu, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 14,31,33,48<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The dominant cover over  the  sediments  is  laterite  and  sand  dunes. The  alteration  noted  in  some  of  the  sequences  is  oxidation,  kaolinisation and sericitisation. Field data was collected from 47 station points (see Appendix for station  point spreadsheet). 4.1.2 Falagountou  The Falagountou orpaillage is located to the East of the Essakane main deposit. The pit is ~100×200m in  dimension (Fig. || Essakane  Plutons  Falagountou  Sokadie  30 km  Dori Batholith  Figure 6.1: Aeromagnetic photograph of the study area indicating the locations of the plutons in the area  (Photograph courtesy of A.

Taner  (2004)  recognised  a  relationship  between  the  gold  mineralisation  and  intrusions  in  the  Falagountou and Essakane deposits. The gold in these deposits can be classified as mesothermal lode  gold, thermal-aureole gold or intrusion-related gold. 1 || N  N  32km  Essakane  Falagountou  Sokadie  8km  Figure 1.2: LANDSAT image of the Oudalan-Gorouol Greenstone belt in Burkina Faso and the locations of the deposits  4 || The  mineral  pyrite  occurred  in  the  form  of  anhedral  masses  as  minor  product  of  the  reaction  of  feldspars  to  produce sericite (Robb, 2007). Subsequent to sericitisation, silicification appears through the addition  of quartz in the wallrock. Quartz-carbonate veins are interpreted to be the result of silicification and  carbonatisation of the sequences. These veins crosscut the lithology and they follow open-space fill  morphology with the quartz rimming the outside of the veins and the ankerite developing towards the  centre of the veins. Calcite is the product of later carbonatisation and is extensive in the wallrock of  the  intrusions  in  Falagountou. Sericitisation,  silicification  and  carbonatisation  are  tentatively  interpreted as prograde reactions of contact metamorphism. || The  precipitation  of  sulphides  and  gold  followed  during  this  process. Chloritisation  with  sulphidation  is  interpreted as the Au forming phase. The  interpretation  of  the  data  indicates  that  the  deposits  of  Falagountou,  Essakane  and  Sokadie  formed during the Eburnean orogeny subsequent to the intrusion and cooling of granitoid plutons. The  mineralisation  occurred  during  post  peak  metamorphism  and  is  defined  by  chloritisation  of  the  sequences. The  mineralogy  indicates  that  the  deposits  are  situated  proximal  (middle-aureole)  to  the  granitoids. The  mineralisation  is  hosted  in  quartz-carbonate-chlorite  stockwork  veins. || Two of the three sites i.e. Falagountou and Sokadie are still artisanal mining sites and  Essakane is a developing mine. Essakane is the main deposit and is 11km×3km in dimension, with  Falagountou  and  Sokadie  located  to  the  East  and  south  of  the  Essakane  metasedimentary  belt,  respectively (Kerr(b), 2004).

The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by  meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et  al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can  be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have  identified  that    quartz-vein  hosted  gold  in the  Birimian  of  West  African  craton  can  be  attributed  to  deformation in the Eburnean Orogeny (Hastings, 1982; Milési et al., 1992; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 1993;  Béziat et al., 2008).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Niger<br><b>Pages:</b> 7,8,8<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by  meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et  al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can  be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have  identified  that    quartz-vein  hosted  gold  in the  Birimian  of  West  African  craton  can  be  attributed  to  deformation in the Eburnean Orogeny (Hastings, 1982; Milési et al., 1992; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 1993;  Béziat et al., 2008). || Essakane  Plutons  Falagountou  Sokadie  30 km  Dori Batholith  Figure 6.1: Aeromagnetic photograph of the study area indicating the locations of the plutons in the area  (Photograph courtesy of A.

Chloritisation  with  sulphidation  is  interpreted as the Au forming phase. The  interpretation  of  the  data  indicates  that  the  deposits  of  Falagountou,  Essakane  and  Sokadie  formed during the Eburnean orogeny subsequent to the intrusion and cooling of granitoid plutons. The  mineralisation  occurred  during  post  peak  metamorphism  and  is  defined  by  chloritisation  of  the  sequences. The  mineralogy  indicates  that  the  deposits  are  situated  proximal  (middle-aureole)  to  the  granitoids. The  mineralisation  is  hosted  in  quartz-carbonate-chlorite  stockwork  veins. || Two of the three sites i.e. Falagountou and Sokadie are still artisanal mining sites and  Essakane is a developing mine. Essakane is the main deposit and is 11km×3km in dimension, with  Falagountou  and  Sokadie  located  to  the  East  and  south  of  the  Essakane  metasedimentary  belt,  respectively (Kerr(b), 2004). The  dominant  stratigraphic  sequences  that  have  been  identified  in  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt are a volcaniclastic greywacke sequence and an interbedded conglomerate-greywacke-siltstone- shale  sequence,  which  have  been  contact  metamorphosed  to  hornblende-hornfels  facies  during  the  emplacement  of  igneous  bodies  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). The  environment  of  deposition  is  interpreted to be a shallow marine continental shelf (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The  supracrustal  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  have  experienced  two  deformation  events  that  resulted  in  the  formation  of  shears,  folds,  mylonite  zones  and  regional  metamorphism;  contact  metamorphism  resulted  from  the  dolerite  dykes  intruding  the  area  and  the  emplacement  of  syn- and post-orogenic plutons (Tshibubudze et al., 2009).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sokadie, Falagountou, Séno, Sahel, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 10,14,42,49,50,7<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The structures mapped indicate that the deposit is in a  shear zone. The shear zone is characterised by intensely foliated, crenulated, chloritised greenschist  rocks. The  greenschist  rocks  are  composed  of  quartz,  plagioclase,  epidote,  chlorite,  muscovite  with  developed of arsenopyrite. The quartz-carbonate veins cross-cutting this unit are intensely folded and boudinaged, and brecciated  buck quartz veins occur within the shear zone. The rock outcrops become progressively sheared when  approaching  the  shear  zone  (towards  the  south). || The Essakane deposit is described as quartz-carbonate hosted sulphide stockwork, with arsenopyrite- pyrite  gold  mineralisation  (Kerr  (b),  2004;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009),  which  formed  during  the  D2  deformation event (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Sokadie deposit is hosted in a shear zone, and it is  situated  proximally  to  the  Dori  batholith  (Kerr  (a),  2004). The  mineralisation  in  the  Falagountou  deposit  has  been  interpreted  to  be  a  stockwork  of  veinlets  of  quartz±carbonate-sulphide  (Kerr  (c),  2004). The veinlets are hosted in the metasedimentary rocks together with the intrusive rocks found in  the area (Kerr (c), 2004). 8<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sokadie, Falagountou, Séno, Sahel, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 14,29<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

(2006)  and  Béziat  et  al. (2008),  the  Birimian  terrains  consists  of  sedimentary  basins,  and  linear  to  arcuate  volcanic belts that  correspond to the period of accretion during the Eburnean orogeny. The north-eastern Burkina Faso consists of the Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic  Birimian sequences (2184–2135 Ma) (Davis et al., 1994). The sequences are divided into the upper  and lower Birimian. These are unconformably overlain by the Tarkwa Group (2194-2132 Ma), first  described  in  the  Birim  River  in  Ghana  and  are  believed  to  be  derivatives  of  the  upper  Birimian  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Dzigbodi-Adjimah,  1993;  Bossiére  et  al.,  1996;  Davis  et  al.,  1994). || (2009), refutes the notion that the conglomerate units in the Birimian of  Burkina Faso are Tarkwaian. North-eastern  Burkina  Faso  is  characterised  by  three  tectonic  events;  D1,  D2  and  D3  termed  the  Tangaean  event,  Eburnean  Orogeny  and  the  Wabo-Tampelse  event,  respectfully  (Hein,  2009;  Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Tangaean event resulted in the development of a NW-NNW trending  fold-thrust belt ca. 2171-2130Ma (Hein, 2009). The Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt was intersected  by NE-trending shear zones, related to deformation during the Eburnean orogeny (Tshibubudze et al.,  2009;  Hein,  2009). The  deformation  D2  is  characterised  by  the  development  of  NNE-NE  trending  mylonite and shear zone, F2 folds and a penetrative schistocity (S-C2 to S2), which crosscut the D1  structures (Hein, 2009; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). || Chapter 1  1.1 Introduction  The Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt is located in north-eastern Burkina Faso (Fig. 1.1) in the West  African  craton,  and  extends  into  the  neighbouring  Niger. The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by  meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et  al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can  be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have  identified  that    quartz-vein  hosted  gold  in the  Birimian  of  West  African  craton  can  be  attributed  to  deformation in the Eburnean Orogeny (Hastings, 1982; Milési et al., 1992; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 1993;  Béziat et al., 2008).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 12,13,7<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
