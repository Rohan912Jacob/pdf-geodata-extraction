Introduction  The Bauolé-Mossi domain consists of predominately Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline and  alkaline granitoid intrusions. Theses rocks were emplaced between ca 2.1 to 1.8 Ga (Vega et  al.,  2008). The  presence  of  terranes  that  predates  and  may  act  as  basement  rocks  to  the  Birimian granitoids has been the subject of debate. Basement rocks are typically gneissic to  migmatitic,  thus  the  granitoid-gneissic  terranes  in  the  West  African  Craton  became  the  subject of a number of studies (Eisenhohr and Hirdes, 1992, Pons et al., 1995, Hirdes et al.,  1996,  Gasquet  et  al.,  2003). Lemoine,  1988  in  Gasquet  et  al.,  2003  introduced  the  term  Burkinian,  which  corresponds  to  reworking  of  Archean  rocks  and  formed  the  gneissic  terrance  in  Côte  d’lvoire. || Granitoids  that  are  associated  with  gneisses  and  migmatites  were  previously  described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded  that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the  Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each  other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may  predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation  event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism. || The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  exhibit  some  similarities  to  granitoid-gneissic  terranes  in  Côte  d’lvoire,  NE  Burkina  Faso  and  Senegal. The  study  area  may  have  formed  under  processes  similar  to  those  that  formed  granitoid-gneisses  in  the  above  countries. Therefore, the Saaba zone was possibly intruded by the Pissila batholith. The intrusion leads  to partial melting and migmatization of the gneisses. Analysis of microstructures in the Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone gneiss suggests the  rocks were subjected to two deformation events. The Saaba zone gneiss and migmatites was  deformed to amphibolites facies during D1 deformation event.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Côte d'Ivoire<br><b>Pages:</b> 35,4,5<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The sample’s REE  pattern is depleted relative to the granodiorite, gneisses and K-rich vein. The flat REE pattern  suggests that the migmatite’s source rock lacked garnet. || The spider diagram of the studied granodiorite is comparable with spider diagrams for the  Dabakala region in Côte d’lvoire  (appendix 1) (Gasquet et al., 2003).

The  positive  Sr  coupled  with  Eu  anomaly,  indicates  that  plagioclase  was  not  retained  in  the  residuum  during  partial  melting  or  fractionated  during  magma  differentiation  (Rollinson,  1993; Holland & Turekian, 2003). 7.4.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Côte d'Ivoire<br><b>Pages:</b> 26,31,37<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Methodology  Field work  Samples from the Pissila batholith and the Saaba Zone gneiss were collected during field  work  in  January  2012. Mapping  of  the  study  area  and  sample  collection  was  conducted  by  Profs. Kerstin  Saalmann  and  Kim  Ncube-Hein. The  locations  of  each  station  point  were  recorded  using  GPS  co-ordinates. The  World  Geodetic  System  (WGS  84)  and  Universal  Transverse Mercator (UTM) in meters were used as the datum and format, respectively. || 7. Discussion  7.1. Comparison between the gneiss and granodiorite  The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  gneiss  are  petrologically  and  geochemically  different from each other. The granodiorite exhibit a composition that is more mafic relative  to the gneiss and migmatite. This is apparent in the thin section where hornblende and biotite  are  dominant  in  the  granodiorite  relative  to  the  gneiss  and  migmatite. In  general,  the  granodiorite  exhibit  higher  oxide  content  relative  to  the  gneiss  and  migmatite,  with  an  exception to SiO2 and K2O. || 7.5. Comparison other regions in the craton similar to the study area  Granitoid  intrusion  associated  with  orthogneiss  and  migmatites  where  previously  described by Hirdes et al., 1996, Doumbia et al., 1998, Gasquet et al., 2003, Naba et al., 2004  and Vegas et al., 2008. The Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone gneiss are petrologically and  geochemically  similar  to  gneissic  terranes  in  the  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids  in  the  Dabakala region, Côte d’lvoire and the batholiths in north eastern Burkina Faso (appendix 1). Therefore,  the  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  were  possibly  derived  from  similar  processes  that  formed  the  above  regions. In  both  regions  the  granitoids  are  associated  with  first  group  of  granitoid  intrusion  ca  2.1  Ga,  which  is  similar  to  the  age  (2143  ±12  Ma  and  2117 ±17Ma) of the Pissila batholith (Gasquet et al., 2003, Vegas et al., 2008). In  a  study  of  granitoid-gneissic  terrane  in  the  Dabakala  region,  Hirdes  et  al.,  1996  proposed  that  the  gneisses  where  intruded  by  younger  batholiths. || 8. Conclusion  Petrology  and  geochemistry  suggests  the  Pissila batholith  and  the Saaba  zone  gneiss  are  differ  from  each  other. The  gneisses  exhibit  some  affiliations  to  Archean  TTG. The  Pissila  batholith  does  not  vary  too  much  from  other  calc-alkaline  intrusions  in  the  craton. Geochronology  of  the  batholith  produces  age  of  2143  ±12  Ma  and  2117  ±17  Ma. Emplacement was coeval with the Eburnean orogeny ca 2.1 Ga. || Abstract   The  Pissila  batholith  is  a  foliated  coarse-grained  granodiorite,  which  is  located  in  north  eastern Burkina Faso. The batholith was emplaced at 2143 ±12 Ma and 2117 ±17Ma, coeval  with  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  Eburnean  orogeny  represents  a  period  of  major  crustal  growth in an island arc setting. The batholith is geochemically similar to other calc-alkaline  granitoids in the domain. The Saaba zone gneiss, which is locally migmatitic is located within  the  Pissila  batholith. Geochemically,  the  gneiss  and  migmatites  have  some  Archean  TTG  affiliations. || D2 lead to greenschist facies  metamorphism of both the Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone. Despite petrography and geochemistry indicating that the  Pissila batholith and the Saaba  zone gneiss are unrelated, more conclusive data is required. Therefore, geochronology of the  Saaba  zone  is  necessary  to  validate  the  study  results. Geochronology  would  also  allow  for  better comparison of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terranes in the craton. 35 || Granitoids  that  are  associated  with  gneisses  and  migmatites  were  previously  described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded  that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the  Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each  other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may  predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation  event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism. || The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  exhibit  some  similarities  to  granitoid-gneissic  terranes  in  Côte  d’lvoire,  NE  Burkina  Faso  and  Senegal.

Discussion  7.1. Comparison between the gneiss and granodiorite  The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  gneiss  are  petrologically  and  geochemically  different from each other. The granodiorite exhibit a composition that is more mafic relative  to the gneiss and migmatite. This is apparent in the thin section where hornblende and biotite  are  dominant  in  the  granodiorite  relative  to  the  gneiss  and  migmatite. In  general,  the  granodiorite  exhibit  higher  oxide  content  relative  to  the  gneiss  and  migmatite,  with  an  exception to SiO2 and K2O. || 7.5. Comparison other regions in the craton similar to the study area  Granitoid  intrusion  associated  with  orthogneiss  and  migmatites  where  previously  described by Hirdes et al., 1996, Doumbia et al., 1998, Gasquet et al., 2003, Naba et al., 2004  and Vegas et al., 2008. The Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone gneiss are petrologically and  geochemically  similar  to  gneissic  terranes  in  the  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids  in  the  Dabakala region, Côte d’lvoire and the batholiths in north eastern Burkina Faso (appendix 1). Therefore,  the  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  were  possibly  derived  from  similar  processes  that  formed  the  above  regions. In  both  regions  the  granitoids  are  associated  with  first  group  of  granitoid  intrusion  ca  2.1  Ga,  which  is  similar  to  the  age  (2143  ±12  Ma  and  2117 ±17Ma) of the Pissila batholith (Gasquet et al., 2003, Vegas et al., 2008). In  a  study  of  granitoid-gneissic  terrane  in  the  Dabakala  region,  Hirdes  et  al.,  1996  proposed  that  the  gneisses  where  intruded  by  younger  batholiths. || 8. Conclusion  Petrology  and  geochemistry  suggests  the  Pissila batholith  and  the Saaba  zone  gneiss  are  differ  from  each  other. The  gneisses  exhibit  some  affiliations  to  Archean  TTG. The  Pissila  batholith  does  not  vary  too  much  from  other  calc-alkaline  intrusions  in  the  craton. Geochronology  of  the  batholith  produces  age  of  2143  ±12  Ma  and  2117  ±17  Ma. Emplacement was coeval with the Eburnean orogeny ca 2.1 Ga. || D2 lead to greenschist facies  metamorphism of both the Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone. Despite petrography and geochemistry indicating that the  Pissila batholith and the Saaba  zone gneiss are unrelated, more conclusive data is required. Therefore, geochronology of the  Saaba  zone  is  necessary  to  validate  the  study  results. Geochronology  would  also  allow  for  better comparison of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terranes in the craton. 35 || Granitoids  that  are  associated  with  gneisses  and  migmatites  were  previously  described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded  that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the  Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each  other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may  predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation  event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism. || The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  exhibit  some  similarities  to  granitoid-gneissic  terranes  in  Côte  d’lvoire,  NE  Burkina  Faso  and  Senegal.

Therefore, the Saaba zone was possibly intruded by the Pissila batholith. The intrusion leads  to partial melting and migmatization of the gneisses.
