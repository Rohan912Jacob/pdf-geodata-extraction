The SFZ follows the steeply westerly dipping contact between greywacke to the west and  impure carbonates to the east and its wallrock are intruded by discontinuous diorite and quartz- feldspar-porphyry dykes (Hanssen et al., 1998; Robins, 2006). The Sadiola Hill deposit is also located at the margin of the inner and intermediate contact  metamorphic aureole of the Alamoutala-Sekekoto plutonic system identified by (Hein and  Tshibubudze, 2007b). Dating of the Alamoutala-Sekekoto granodiorite gave an age of 2083 ± 7 Ma  and is taken as the age of gold mineralisation in the Sadiola goldfield (U-Pb zircon) (WAXI, 2013). Based on geophysical data, the plutonic system is interpreted to be situated directly below the Sadiola  goldfield and is represented by projections of tonalite dykes in pits from the upper surface of the  pluton, and it crops out at Alamoutala (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Alteration assemblages identified include calc-silicate, potassic, chlorite–calcite, carbonate and  silicification with gold mainly associated with both arsenic and antimony dominated sulphide  assemblages including arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, stibnite and gudmuntite (Hanssen et al., 1998;  Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Alamoutala, Communauté rurale de Sinthiou Malème, Arrondissement de Koussanar, Département de Tambacounda, Tambacounda Region, Senegal<br><b>Pages:</b> 12<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Aims and Objectives  The main aim of this research project is to derive an ore genetic model that characterizes the potential  source of gold mineralization and the style of deposition at the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, by  petrographical investigation of the host rocks and associated sulphides. Microscopic analyses will be  used to identify any characteristic indicator minerals which characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit,  alteration and sulphide assemblages. A detailed study of mineralogy, alteration assemblage and  microstructures will be of importance in contrasting the intrusion-related style with the shear-hosted  style hypotheses with which the difference will be used to establish the most likely model for the  Sadiola Hill deposit. 1.4 Abbreviations and acronyms  WAC – West African Craton  KKI – Kedougou Kenieba Inlier  SMFZ – Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone  MTSZ – Main Transcurrent Shear Zone  TTG – Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite  SFZ – Sadiola Fracture Zone  QFP – Quartz-feldspar porphyry || The main focus of this project has therefore been to derive an ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill  gold deposit by contrasting the intrusion related style hypothesis proposed for the deposit by Theron  (1997) with the shear-hosted style hypothesis proposed by Hanssen et al. (1998) using petrographic  analysis. The features which will characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit (i.e. indicator minerals,  alteration assemblage and mineral textures) will be used to contrast the two models and to establish a  likely model for the deposit. 1.2 Location and Physiography  The Sadiola Hill gold mine is situated in the Sadiola goldfield, in western Mali at about 77km south of  the regional capital, Kayes, near the international border of Mali with Senegal (Fig.1).

The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises  meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and  marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two  facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite  and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part  of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta- sedimentary rocks. || Figure 1: Locality map of Mali showing neighbouring countries, Sadiola and other gold mines with  estimated reserves, and the occurrence of the Birimian rocks (IAMGold.com)  1.3. Aims and Objectives  The main aim of this research project is to derive an ore genetic model that characterizes the potential  source of gold mineralization and the style of deposition at the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, by  petrographical investigation of the host rocks and associated sulphides. Microscopic analyses will be  used to identify any characteristic indicator minerals which characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit,  alteration and sulphide assemblages. A detailed study of mineralogy, alteration assemblage and  microstructures will be of importance in contrasting the intrusion-related style with the shear-hosted  style hypotheses with which the difference will be used to establish the most likely model for the  Sadiola Hill deposit. 1.4 Abbreviations and acronyms  WAC – West African Craton  KKI – Kedougou Kenieba Inlier  SMFZ – Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone  MTSZ – Main Transcurrent Shear Zone  TTG – Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite  SFZ – Sadiola Fracture Zone  QFP – Quartz-feldspar porphyry<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sadiola, Kayes Cercle, Kayes, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 5,8<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Sulphide mineralisation is associated with shear fabrics. The mineral and sulphide textures observed  in this study suggest that this is not the case for the Sadiola Hill deposit as there were no visible shear  fabrics (foliation), compressional evidence and greenschist facies. However the Sadiola deposit does  have few features which are similar to those of shear-hosted deposits, these are: (a) carbonate  alteration, (b) sulphides hosted in and around tectonic structures and (c) host rocks are  metamorphosed though in the Sadiola Hill deposit it was a result of contact metamorphism rather than  regional metamorphism which generally occurs in shear-hosted deposit. The host rocks of the Sadiola Hill deposit have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and  epidote-chlorite facies which indicates high temperature and low pressure conditions during  metamorphism, i.e., contact metamorphism. Contact metamorphism occurred during cooling and  recrystallization of the tonalite-granodiorite and porphyry-quartz-feldspar dykes, and the Sekokoto  pluton which from the alteration patterns and metamorphic facies assemblage, is suggested to be  located on the south-eastern margin of the Sadiola main pit. || Lithology  The steeply west dipping lithologies of the Sadiola Hill gold deposit are dominated by greywacke,  carbonate, marble and volcanics as recorded by Hanssen et al. (1998). The greywacke forms the  hangingwall of the deposit. Greywacke and feldspathic greywacke are biotite bearing (Hanssen et al.,  1998; Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). These greywacke units are massive with sharp bases (to the  west), show an upward gradation and cross bedding at all scales, and are best developed to the west of  the SFZ (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b; Boshoff et al., 1998). Carbonate rocks in the Sadiola deposit are impure marble which consists of alternating beds of dark  pelite-rich carbonate and light coloured carbonate rich beds (Hanssen et al., 1998). || The  deposits are characterized by shear fabrics that are associated with sulphide mineralisation. The Sadiola deposit is unique in West Africa as most of the deposits are structurally controlled (e.g. Ashanti in Ghana; Essakane in Burkina Faso; Tongon in Cote d’Ivoire, and others), but it shows  similarities with the Morila gold mine in southern Mali which is an intrusion-related deposit  (McFarlane et al. 2012). || mine are mined by Société D’Exploitation des Mines d’Or de Sadiola S.A (SEMOS), which is a Joint  Venture between AngloGold Ashanti, IFC and the government of Mali. The Sadiola goldfield is located within folded and altered sedimentary rocks of the Kofi Supergroup,  which have been intruded by a number of felsic intrusions. The metasedimentary rocks consist of fine  grained greywacke and impure carbonates with minor tuffs and acid volcanics (Hanssen et al., 1998). These lithologies show evidence of macroscopic to mesoscopic slump structures (Hein and  Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). Carbonate, greywacke, quartz-feldspar-porphyry and diorite are the main  host to the Sadiola deposit (Boshoff et al., 1998).

The Sekokoto pluton is part of the Alamoutala- Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system first described by Hein (2007a). Contact metamorphism was responsible for alteration in the host rocks; gold-sulphide mineralisation  occurs in this alteration zone. Mineralisation consists of a polymetallic sulphide assemblage and  tourmaline which are basic indicators of an intrusion-related style deposit.

The goldfield is a mine camp which hosts  several deposits which include the FE3 and FE4 open cast pits. These together with the Sadiola Hill || Abstract  The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which  is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises  meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and  marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two  facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite  and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part  of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta- sedimentary rocks. || Chapter 1: Introduction  The Sadiola Hill gold mine is located within the Sadiola goldfield in the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier  (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC) and is situated in western Mali. The Sadiola  goldfield is located close to the Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system and mineralisation  has been shown to have a relationship with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and diorite dykes. The  goldfield also hosts the FE3, FE4, Timbabougouni mines, and FE2 and Tambali prospects. The  relative association of mineralisation with highly deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Birimian  Supergroup makes it difficult to derive an ore genetic model. The model is important for regional and  in-mine exploration, but also significant for understanding geologic evolution of the host rocks. A number of different ore genesis models have been proposed for Sadiola Hill deposit. || The FE3 pits are also situated within the Sadiola goldfield (Fig. 12) and contain similar host rocks to  those of the Sadiola Hill deposit. The slump folds indicate a period of folding in the deposit and are  interpreted to be related to the D1 tectonic phase described by Milési et al. (1989, 1992). Folding and  thrusting events are typical for the Birimian formations (e.g. Kadio et al. || The Kofi Supergroup is obliquely cut by the N-S to NNW trending Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone,  whereas the Sadiola deposit occurs along the NNE striking Sadiola Fracture Zone (SFZ) (Robins,  2006). The SFZ follows the steeply westerly dipping contact between greywacke to the west and  impure carbonates to the east and its wallrock are intruded by discontinuous diorite and quartz- feldspar-porphyry dykes (Hanssen et al., 1998; Robins, 2006). The Sadiola Hill deposit is also located at the margin of the inner and intermediate contact  metamorphic aureole of the Alamoutala-Sekekoto plutonic system identified by (Hein and  Tshibubudze, 2007b). Dating of the Alamoutala-Sekekoto granodiorite gave an age of 2083 ± 7 Ma  and is taken as the age of gold mineralisation in the Sadiola goldfield (U-Pb zircon) (WAXI, 2013). Based on geophysical data, the plutonic system is interpreted to be situated directly below the Sadiola  goldfield and is represented by projections of tonalite dykes in pits from the upper surface of the  pluton, and it crops out at Alamoutala (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Alteration assemblages identified include calc-silicate, potassic, chlorite–calcite, carbonate and  silicification with gold mainly associated with both arsenic and antimony dominated sulphide  assemblages including arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, stibnite and gudmuntite (Hanssen et al., 1998;  Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). || The carbonates  include a massive, grey dolomite-marble and carbonaceous greywacke, and siltstone units which  occur in a number of pits within the Sadiola goldfield (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). The igneous rocks at the Sadiola mine include diorite, lamprophyre dykes and quartz-feldspar  porphyry. The diorite is composed of alkali-rich plagioclase and hornblende, and grades into coarse  biotite-rich diorite which contains sulphides (Hanssen et al., 1998; Hein, 2008). This intrusion was  characterized by Theron (1997a) as having similar composition as the TTG suite rocks, which are  widespread across the WAC (WAXI, 2013). The quartz-feldspar-porphyry (QFP) dykes have been recorded in outcrop in the Sadiola opencast  (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a).The quartz porphyry host rare tourmaline crystals (Hanssen et al.,  1998). QFP dykes often intrude along steep west dipping, NNE trending faults and crosscut the  diorites (Robins, 2006). || The main focus of this project has therefore been to derive an ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill  gold deposit by contrasting the intrusion related style hypothesis proposed for the deposit by Theron  (1997) with the shear-hosted style hypothesis proposed by Hanssen et al. (1998) using petrographic  analysis. The features which will characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit (i.e. indicator minerals,  alteration assemblage and mineral textures) will be used to contrast the two models and to establish a  likely model for the deposit. 1.2 Location and Physiography  The Sadiola Hill gold mine is situated in the Sadiola goldfield, in western Mali at about 77km south of  the regional capital, Kayes, near the international border of Mali with Senegal (Fig.1).

The Sekokoto pluton is part of the Alamoutala- Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system first described by Hein (2007a). Contact metamorphism was responsible for alteration in the host rocks; gold-sulphide mineralisation  occurs in this alteration zone. Mineralisation consists of a polymetallic sulphide assemblage and  tourmaline which are basic indicators of an intrusion-related style deposit. Plutonism was concomitant  with hornblende-hornfels facies contact metamorphism of the meta-sedimentary rocks and gold  mineralization throughout the Sadiola goldfield (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a). From the  observations and interpretation made above, it is clear that mineralisation in the Sadiola Hill deposit is  not shear-hosted as suggested by Hanssen et al. || Abstract  The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which  is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises  meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and  marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two  facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite  and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part  of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta- sedimentary rocks. || As described in Chapter, shear-zone related deposit develop syntectonically in horizontal  compressions and the host rocks are generally regionally metamorphosed under low-to-mid  greenschist facies conditions, and also the deposit is situated within and/or around a shear zone. Sulphide mineralisation is associated with shear fabrics. The mineral and sulphide textures observed  in this study suggest that this is not the case for the Sadiola Hill deposit as there were no visible shear  fabrics (foliation), compressional evidence and greenschist facies. However the Sadiola deposit does  have few features which are similar to those of shear-hosted deposits, these are: (a) carbonate  alteration, (b) sulphides hosted in and around tectonic structures and (c) host rocks are  metamorphosed though in the Sadiola Hill deposit it was a result of contact metamorphism rather than  regional metamorphism which generally occurs in shear-hosted deposit. The host rocks of the Sadiola Hill deposit have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and  epidote-chlorite facies which indicates high temperature and low pressure conditions during  metamorphism, i.e., contact metamorphism. Contact metamorphism occurred during cooling and  recrystallization of the tonalite-granodiorite and porphyry-quartz-feldspar dykes, and the Sekokoto  pluton which from the alteration patterns and metamorphic facies assemblage, is suggested to be  located on the south-eastern margin of the Sadiola main pit.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sekokoto, Bafoulabé Cercle, Kayes, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 36,37,5<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

These two shields are separated by the Taoudeni basin, which is Neoproterozoic to  Devonian in age and are entirely surrounded by Pan African and Hercynian belts (Matthias et al. 2002). The Reguibat shield contains Palaeoproterozoic assemblages in the eastern part as well as  Archean relicts which include kimberlites (Ennih and Liegeois, 2008).

(2011) for the Morila gold mine in  southeast Mali, which is classified as intrusion related gold deposit. The brecciated units are scattered around the contact aureole of the tonalite-granodiorite (Matabane,  2008) and formed as a result of high pressure fluid circulation or by dilantacy accompanied by  hydraulic fracturing during emplacement of the granodiorite dykes (e.g. Ethendge, 1983). The former  correlates with skarn development described by Theron (1997a). The hydrothermal minerals in the Sadiola Hill deposit are randomly orientated (i.e.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Mali, Jianhe, Qiandongnan, Guizhou, China<br><b>Pages:</b> 34<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Hornblende occurs on  the contact of meta-greywacke and marble; this might suggest a possible transition zone of  metamorphic facies from epidote-albite facies in the east of the pit to hornblende-hornfels facies in the  west of the pit. All the boreholes studied intersected tonalite dykes at depth greater that 300m before intersecting  massive sulphides and hornfels. The massive sulphides make up the main portion of the Sadiola Hill  orebody. Ore minerals are oxidised (e.g. pyrite) but pyrrhotite can still be recognised.<br><b>Geocode:</b> The PIT, West 29th Street, NoMad, Chelsea District, Manhattan, New York County, New York, 10001, United States<br><b>Pages:</b> 18<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
