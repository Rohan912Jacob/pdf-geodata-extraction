properties among a multitude of other solutions. Also  most  geological  structures  are  not  detectable  by  only  one  geophysical  method,  which 
therefore  requires  a  combination  of  several  geophysical  methods  to  constrain  structures  and 
geological  domains. The  combination  of  geophysical  methods  is  an  optimization  that  supports  the 
geophysical interpretation and contributes in determining the geological elements that are important in 
developing an understanding of the subsurface geology. The limitation in optimisation is the cost of 
applying multiple geophysical techniques and methods. With this in mind, this project aims to use a combination of geophysical methods for modelling 
by integrating the available geological data to build a 3D geophysical model of the study area, and to 
interpret  geological  structures  and  geological  domains. Specifically,  the  aims  are  to  (1)  establish 
tectonic domains in the south of Mali and northeast of Guinea; (2) to determine if structures (shears, 
faults, etc.) beneath the thin sedimentary cover (up to 100m) potential to host structurally-hosted gold
