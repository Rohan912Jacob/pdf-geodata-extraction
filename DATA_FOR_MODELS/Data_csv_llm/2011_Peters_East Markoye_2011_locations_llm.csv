2011_Peters_East Markoye_2011.txt,2,"Abstract 
The  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  are  largely  made  up  of 
supracrustal,  island-arc  derived  sediments  including,  but  not  limited  to,  thick  greywacke 
sequences. These were deposited in a deltaic-shelf environment on the margin of a back-arc 
basin. The  local  stratigraphy  has  been  constrained  by  facies  variation  determined  by 
sedimentary  features  and  differences  in  the  depositional  environment. Regional  low-middle 
greenschist  metamorphism  is  shown  by  the  ubiquitous  presence  of  chlorite,  epidote  and 
minor  muscovite  and  is  suggested  to  be  a  result  of  large  TTG  pluton  emplacement  that 
occurred  syn-tectonically  with  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. This  thesis  proposes  it  is  due  to 
diastathermal  metamorphism  caused  by  back-arc  extension  and  mantle  upwelling. Contact 
metamorphism of the greywacke to hornblende-hornfels facies occurs within close proximity 
of  the  calc-alkaline  dykes.",Oudalan-Gourouol Greenstone Belt

The  WAC,  namely  the  Birimian  Supergroup,  consists  of  many  island  arc  terranes  that 
underwent terrane accretion (2300-2250 Ma). This occurred during the process of subduction, 
thus  creating  a  felsic  continental  crust  due  to  its  association  with  TTG,  calc-alkaline 
plutonism (Klein and Moura., 2009). Following this, other cratonic blocks  which formed in 
the  same  way,  collided  with  the  accreted  arcs  to  form  orogenic  belts  and  the  closure  of  an 
oceanic basin. The Eburnean Orogeny is an example of this process (Hirdes et al., 1996; Hein 
et al., 2004; Feybesse et al., 2006). The OGGB is one of the island arc terranes, and the east 
Markoye  region  is  most  likely  a  small,  but  proximal  to  the  source,  portion  of  the  back-arc 
basin.",east Markoye region
