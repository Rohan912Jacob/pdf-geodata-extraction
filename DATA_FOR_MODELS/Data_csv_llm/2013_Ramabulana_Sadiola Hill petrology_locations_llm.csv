The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which 
is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises 
meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and 
marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two 
facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite 
and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part 
of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta-
sedimentary rocks.",Sadiola Hill deposit

The main aim of this research project is to derive an ore genetic model that characterizes the potential 
source of gold mineralization and the style of deposition at the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, by 
petrographical investigation of the host rocks and associated sulphides. Microscopic analyses will be 
used to identify any characteristic indicator minerals which characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit,

microstructures will be of importance in contrasting the intrusion-related style with the shear-hosted 
style hypotheses with which the difference will be used to establish the most likely model for the

The Sadiola Hill deposit has complex mineral textures in quartz-carbonate veins due to fracturing 
events, brecciation of the host rocks, alteration and crosscutting relationships. The quartz-carbonate 
sulphides are dominated by sulphides, silicate, and carbonate minerals that form an aggregate. These 
minerals and sulphides are not greatly affected by deformational events but are affected by supergene 
processes. The mineral textures of the deposit are described in four different sections which consider

granitoid intrusions and mineralisation from boreholes in the Sadiola Hill deposit. 6.1 Software Limits 
Unfortunately, the software did not model the lithological contacts well and only recognises 
horizontal sections. As a result, all the host rocks are shown as a horizontal box, which was not ideal. Vertical granodiorite dykes were also modelled automatically as horizontal elements which was not 
logical; the software takes the upper and lower contacts of the element in each borehole and correlates 
them laterally rather than allowing in input parameters that models them as vertical.",Sadiola Hill deposit

slump folds are crosscut by tonalite dykes, which indicates that folding occurred at an earlier stage. Original minerals in the host rocks have been slightly and/or completely changed to new minerals. This is observed in alteration zones were plagioclase has been replaced by carbonate (dolomite ± 
calcite) and locally by albite, while biotite is slightly replaced by chlorite, rutile and vermiculite. Mineral replacement reactions take place primarily by dissolution-reprecipitation processes. This 
includes: cation exchange, chemical weathering, deuteric alteration, leaching, pseudormorphism, 
metasomatism and metamorphism (Putnis, 2002). The occurrence of biotite in vein-wallrock contacts 
in the Sadiola Hill deposit is indicative of either metasomatism and/or metamorphism reactions.",Sadiola Hill deposit

Baker, 2001), and therefore conclusion that can be made is that contact metamorphism of host rocks 
in the Sadiola Hill deposit is associated with the adjacent tonalite-granodiorite and/or quartz-porphyry 
dykes. Tourmaline is a common accessory mineral in metamorphic rocks spanning a wide of bulk 
compositions (e.g., Henry and Dutrow, 1996), and has P-T conditions ranging from diagenesis to the

precipitated at a later stage and thus coexist. Precipitation of this assemblage is interpreted to have 
been coeval with potassic alteration (Boshoff et al., 1998), although in most cases they are associated 
with biotite-chlorite alteration in vein margins and in the wall rock matrix. The distribution of gold 
and sulphides in alteration zones indicates that they are of hydrothermal epigenetic origin. The biotite 
isograd associated with gold mineralisation marks the boundary between the inner and middle contact 
aureoles which occurs along the Sadiola Fracture Zone, which might have been a pathway for the gold

An ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill deposit has been a much debated topic. A number of models 
were suggested for the deposit but only two stood out, which included the shear-hosted model by 
Hanssen et al. (1998) and the intrusion related model by Theron (1997). The two models contrast in 
terms of style of mineralisation, alteration assemblages, mineral textures and relationship between the 
host rocks and mineralisation. From the study, only a few features which characterise shear-hosted 
deposits were present but the features can also be found in intrusion related deposit. The Sadiola Hill deposit was metamorphosed by contact metamorphism during the emplacement of 
the tonalite-granodiorite and porphyry dykes, these dykes are also responsible for the fluids which 
altered the host rocks.",Sadiola Hill deposit
