 
Identify the metal enrichment associations of the deposits in order to provide a

  Characterise the structural evolution of the district by integrating field mapping 
data with geophysical data-sets; 
  Frame the tectonic, magmatic, metamorphic and hydrothermal alteration history 
of the gold deposits in time with the help of focused U-Pb geochronology;

The Sadiola Hill deposit shares a number of characteristics typical of  orogenic 
gold deposits worldwide (Mikucki and Ridley, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; McCuaig and 
Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Goldfarb et al., 
2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006)  including  a  late-orogenic  relative 
timing,  strong  regional  (i.e.,  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone)  and  local  structural  controls 
(i.e.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  NNE-trending  shear  array)  on  ore  location  and 
geometry,  and  a  pronounced  Au-As-Sb  metal  enrichment  association. The  metal 
enrichment  association  and  geothermometric  estimates  from  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis are compatible with mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-
epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-300°C) conditions in terms of crustal level based on the 
proposed classification of orogenic gold deposits by Groves et al. (1998). However, the 
high  temperature  ore  and  alteration  paragenesis  at  Sadiola  Hill  is  in  thermal 
disequilibrium  with  host  rocks  at  regional  greenschist-facies  conditions,  which  is 
atypical  for  that  class  of  deposit. Such  geological  feature  alone  is  not  diagnostic  of  a 
magmatic fluid source because it can reflect the interaction of a fluid from any source 
with reactive country rocks at a temperature high enough to form stable actinolite and 
biotite  (Ridley  and  Diamond,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005).",Sadiola Fracture Zone

suggested  that  the  physico-chemical  parameters  of  ore-forming  fluids  associated  with 
Au-As-Sb  deposits  indicate  deep  circulation  of  hydrothermal  solutions,  which  make 
them in disequilibrium with country rocks at the ore deposition level. The late orogenic 
switch  from  fold-and-thrust  tectonics  to  strike-slip  tectonics  along  the  Senegal-Mali 
Shear  Zone  most  likely  promoted  high  fluid  flow  and  the  arrival  of  magmatic  fluids 
with minor heat loss at upper crustal levels, which is consistent with the occurrence of 
voluminous  calc-alkaline  magmatism  at  ca. 2090-2070  Ma. The  high  temperature  ore 
and alteration paragenesis is therefore suggested to represent a transient thermal effect 
associated with syn-kinematic igneous activity at the time of mineralization. Based on

Recent  research  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the  spatial 
association between calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron 
skarn  mineralization,  suggesting  a  complex  fluid  evolution  in  relation  to  the 
development of major gold deposits (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2013a, b). The emplacement 
of Eburnean quartz-feldspar-porphyry stocks in the Alamoutala deposit area resulted in 
the  formation  of  a  low  P-high  T  magnetite-bearing  skarn  in  a  geological  setting 
analogous  to  that  of  the  Falémé  iron  skarns  (e.g.,  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The 
gold  mineralization  is  shear-hosted  and  occured  subsequently  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent 
tectonics,  and 
thus  overprints 
the  contact-metamorphic  mineral 
assemblages. The current study indicates that the magmatic episode occurred at 2083 ±

history of the auriferous residuum through mineralogical, textural and geochronological 
investigations,  and  suggested  that:  1)  the  auriferous  residuum  consists  of  a  mixture  of 
underlying  insoluble  bedrock  fragments  (e.g.,  metagreywacke,  marble,  metadiorite), 
blocks  and  pebbles  of  Neoproterozoic  sandstone,  and  quartz  fragments  and  pebbles, 
which  are  set  into  a  brown-red  sandy  matrix;  2)  the  maximum  deposition  age  for  the 
auriferous residuum is constrained in the Neoproterozoic, or during early deposition of 
the Taoudeni sandstone; 3) the formation of the residuum likely involved a local source 
that included recycled material based on gold grain morphology and detrital zircon ages; 
and  4)  the  creation  of  a  deep  weathering  profile  and  supergene  enrichment  of  the 
auriferous residuum may have taken place during the mid-Cretaceous to early Tertiary. In this study, we summarise the geology, tectonic setting, hydrothermal alteration, and 
ore  mineralogy  of  the  primary  gold  mineralisation  at  Yatela  with  the  objective  of 
defining  its  link  to  the  auriferous  residuum,  and  thus  form  the  basis  of  an  ore  genetic

In November 2013, John Miller, Nicolas Thébaud, and the candidate conducted 
a targeting workshop on the Sadiola mine site with SEMOS personnel and AngloGold 
Ashanti  brownfield  exploration  group. The  targeting  session  used  a  mineral  system 
approach  (e.g.,  McCuaig  and  Beresford,  2009;  McCuaig  et  al.,  2010;  McCuaig  and 
Hronsky,  2014)  in  order  to  identify  and  rank  targets  based  on  research  data  and 
extensive  in-house  knowledge. The  mineral  system  approach  relies  on  the  breakup  of 
the  mineralising  process  into  a  series  of  base  critical  processes  that  can  be  treated  as 
independent variables. These range from a primary fluid source region, an active fluid 
pathway,  and  at  the  deposit-scale  a  fluid  sink  related  to  a  physical  throttle  and/or  a 
chemical  trap. This  approach  presents  significant  advantages  over  the  deposit  model
