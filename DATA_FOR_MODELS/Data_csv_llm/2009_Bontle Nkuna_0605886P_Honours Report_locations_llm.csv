The  gold-hosting  sedimentary  sequences  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  underwent  four 
events to give rise to the gold mineralisation. The alteration that resulted during the metamorphism of 
the  rocks  is  linked  to  the  gold  mineralisation. Subsequent  to  deposition  of  sediments,  regional 
metamorphism during the Eburnean orogeny gave rise to greenschist facies metamorphic assemblages 
and  two  deformation  phases. The  first  deformation  phase  resulted  in  development  of  NW-NNW 
trending  folds  (F1),  NW-NNW  trending  foliation  (S1)  and  extensional-conjugate  vein  sets  (V1), 
interpreted  as  Tangaean  (D1)  structures. The  second  deformation  phase  resulted  in  development  of 
NE-NNE trending faults, stockwork veins (V2) and NE trending foliation (S2) associated with dextral 
shear  zones, 
interpreted  as  Eburnean  (D2)  structures. The  sequences  underwent  contact 
metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies during the intrusion of granitoid plutons (syn-Eburnean).",Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt

1.1 Introduction 
The Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt is located in north-eastern Burkina Faso (Fig. 1.1) in the West 
African  craton,  and  extends  into  the  neighbouring  Niger. The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by 
meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et 
al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can 
be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have 
identified  that    quartz-vein  hosted  gold  in the  Birimian  of  West  African  craton  can  be  attributed  to

22 days and a car was provided for transportation to and from the deposit sites. A  LANDSAT  image  of  a  portion  of  north-east  Burkina  Faso  was  used  to obtain  coordinates  of the

The  rock  sequences  in  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  underwent  regional  metamorphism 
characterised by greenschist facies mineral assemblages, with the development of hornblende-hornfels 
assemblages  during  contact  metamorphism. The  sequences  were  cross-cut  by  quartz  and  quartz-
carbonate  dominant  veins. The  events leading  up  to  the  formation  of the ore  can  be  summarised as 
follows: 
1. The  deposition  of  lithologies  on  the  greenstone  belt,  which  include  interbedded  shale-
siltstone-sandstone and volcaniclastic sedimentary sequences. 2. The  regional  metamorphic  event  led  metamorphism  and  deformation  of  the  sequences, 
characterised  by  the  development  of  greenschist  facies  mineral  assemblages  and  NW-NNW 
trending structures (D1) and NE-NNE trending structures (D2).",Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt
