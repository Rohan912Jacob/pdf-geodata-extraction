The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism.",southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt

2013_Peters.txt,3,"The volcanic facies were 
established through field and petrographic interpretations. The subaqueous facies architecture consists 
of proximal, coherent and autoclastic basaltic flow units containing porphyritic, aphyric, amygdaloidal 
and hyaloclastic textures as well as pillowed, jointed and flow-banded basaltic lithofacies. Proximal to 
distal volcanogenic manganese deposits intercalated with basalt flows indicate a syn-volcanic genesis. A  discrete  pyroclastic  interbed  (~300  m  thick)  within  a  volcanogenic,  marginal  marine  to  offshore 
greywacke succession occupies a distal facies relative to the volcanic source and indicates a bimodal 
source of volcanism, i.e., mafic and intermediate. Volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  are  characterized  by  quartz-ankerite  stockwork  breccia,  a 
braunite-ilmenite-magnetite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-(gold)  mineral  assemblage  and 
increased  Ba 
concentrations,  indicating  syn-volcanic  seafloor-related  hydrothermal  activity. The  Goren  volcano-
sedimentary  belt  presents potential for  economic  mineralisation  in  volcanogenic  primary  manganese 
and base metal deposits.",Goren volcano-sedimentary belt

represent  a  prograding  delta  front  adjacent  to  a  shelf  margin. This  is  supported  by  fining  upwards 
sequences interpreted to represent various incomplete, small-scale Bouma sequences (Bouma, 1962). Turbidite flows can account for large  volumes of sediment deposition in a short period of time, thus
