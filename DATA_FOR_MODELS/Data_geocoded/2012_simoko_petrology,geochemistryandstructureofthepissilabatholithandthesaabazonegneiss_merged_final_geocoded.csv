Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each

predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation

to partial melting and migmatization of the gneisses. Analysis of microstructures in the Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone gneiss suggests the

to the gneiss and migmatite. This is apparent in the thin section where hornblende and biotite

differ  from  each  other. The  gneisses  exhibit  some  affiliations  to  Archean  TTG. The  Pissila 
batholith  does  not  vary  too  much  from  other  calc-alkaline  intrusions  in  the  craton. Geochronology  of  the  batholith  produces  age  of  2143  ±12  Ma  and  2117  ±17  Ma. Emplacement was coeval with the Eburnean orogeny ca 2.1 Ga. || Abstract  
The  Pissila  batholith  is  a  foliated  coarse-grained  granodiorite,  which  is  located  in  north 
eastern Burkina Faso. The batholith was emplaced at 2143 ±12 Ma and 2117 ±17Ma, coeval 
with  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  Eburnean  orogeny  represents  a  period  of  major  crustal 
growth in an island arc setting. The batholith is geochemically similar to other calc-alkaline 
granitoids in the domain. The Saaba zone gneiss, which is locally migmatitic is located within 
the  Pissila  batholith. Geochemically,  the  gneiss  and  migmatites  have  some  Archean  TTG 
affiliations. || D2 lead to greenschist facies 
metamorphism of both the Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone. Despite petrography and geochemistry indicating that the  Pissila batholith and the Saaba 
zone gneiss are unrelated, more conclusive data is required. Therefore, geochronology of the 
Saaba  zone  is  necessary  to  validate  the  study  results. Geochronology  would  also  allow  for 
better comparison of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terranes in the craton. 35 || Granitoids  that  are  associated  with  gneisses  and  migmatites  were  previously 
described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded 
that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the 
Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each 
other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may 
predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation 
event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism. || The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  exhibit  some  similarities  to  granitoid-gneissic

Petrology  and  geochemistry  suggests  the  Pissila batholith  and  the Saaba  zone  gneiss  are 
differ  from  each  other. The  gneisses  exhibit  some  affiliations  to  Archean  TTG. The  Pissila 
batholith  does  not  vary  too  much  from  other  calc-alkaline  intrusions  in  the  craton. Geochronology  of  the  batholith  produces  age  of  2143  ±12  Ma  and  2117  ±17  Ma. Emplacement was coeval with the Eburnean orogeny ca 2.1 Ga. || D2 lead to greenschist facies

The  Pissila  batholith  is  a  foliated  coarse-grained  granodiorite,  which  is  located  in  north 
eastern Burkina Faso. The batholith was emplaced at 2143 ±12 Ma and 2117 ±17Ma, coeval 
with  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  Eburnean  orogeny  represents  a  period  of  major  crustal 
growth in an island arc setting. The batholith is geochemically similar to other calc-alkaline 
granitoids in the domain. The Saaba zone gneiss, which is locally migmatitic is located within 
the  Pissila  batholith. Geochemically,  the  gneiss  and  migmatites  have  some  Archean  TTG 
affiliations. || Granitoids  that  are  associated  with  gneisses  and  migmatites  were  previously 
described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded 
that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the 
Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each 
other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may 
predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation
