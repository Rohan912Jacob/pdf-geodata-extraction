only encompassed a minor portion to the north of the study area, the study area has not been 
previously  mapped  or  described. || Abstract 
The  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  are  largely  made  up  of 
supracrustal,  island-arc  derived  sediments  including,  but  not  limited  to,  thick  greywacke 
sequences. These were deposited in a deltaic-shelf environment on the margin of a back-arc 
basin. The  local  stratigraphy  has  been  constrained  by  facies  variation  determined  by 
sedimentary  features  and  differences  in  the  depositional  environment. Regional  low-middle 
greenschist  metamorphism  is  shown  by  the  ubiquitous  presence  of  chlorite,  epidote  and 
minor  muscovite  and  is  suggested  to  be  a  result  of  large  TTG  pluton  emplacement  that 
occurred  syn-tectonically  with  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. This  thesis  proposes  it  is  due  to 
diastathermal  metamorphism  caused  by  back-arc  extension  and  mantle  upwelling. Contact 
metamorphism of the greywacke to hornblende-hornfels facies occurs within close proximity 
of  the  calc-alkaline  dykes. || Abstract 
The  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  are  largely  made  up  of 
supracrustal,  island-arc  derived  sediments  including,  but  not  limited  to,  thick  greywacke 
sequences. These were deposited in a deltaic-shelf environment on the margin of a back-arc 
basin. The  local  stratigraphy  has  been  constrained  by  facies  variation  determined  by 
sedimentary  features  and  differences  in  the  depositional  environment. Regional  low-middle 
greenschist  metamorphism  is  shown  by  the  ubiquitous  presence  of  chlorite,  epidote  and 
minor  muscovite  and  is  suggested  to  be  a  result  of  large  TTG  pluton  emplacement  that 
occurred  syn-tectonically  with  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. This  thesis  proposes  it  is  due  to 
diastathermal  metamorphism  caused  by  back-arc  extension  and  mantle  upwelling. Contact 
metamorphism of the greywacke to hornblende-hornfels facies occurs within close proximity 
of  the  calc-alkaline  dykes.","llm,rules",GEOLOGICAL_UNIT,no-geocode-result,no-geocode-result,no-geocode-result,no-geocode-result

Basin is a shallow marine environment from the Plio-Pleistocene and exhibits a full range of 
sedimentary facies. It is still being in-filled today with sediment from an active volcanic arc 
(Carter and Naish.,  1998). Thick sequences of  greywacke and thin conglomerate beds from 
the Mezozoic are deposited in the 5 km deep basin and overlie basement rocks (Proust et al., 
2005). The basin is interpreted to occupy a back-arc setting today at the convergent margin of 
the  Pacific  and  Australian  plates,  where  rapid  deposition  has  taken  place  due  to  eustatic 
changes  (Carter  and  Naish.,  1998). The  Wanganui  Basin  is  infilled  with  shales,  sandstones 
and  thick  greywacke  sequences  with  intercalated  conglomerate  beds. || The  basin  demonstrates  a  full  range  of  sedimentary  facies. Carter  and 
Naish  (1998)  identified  that  equal  amounts  of  sedimentation  and  subsidence  are  necessary. Uplift  and  subsidence  were,  in  the  case  of  the  Wanganui  Basin,  controlled  by  eustatic 
changes which created an environment prone to rapid deposition. The Wanganui Basin sits in 
a  back-arc  setting  at  the  convergence  of  the  Pacific  Plate  with  the  Australian  Plate. It  is 
possible  that  its  formation  occurred  in  the  same  environment. Lithospheric  loading  and

The  WAC,  namely  the  Birimian  Supergroup,  consists  of  many  island  arc  terranes  that 
underwent terrane accretion (2300-2250 Ma). This occurred during the process of subduction, 
thus  creating  a  felsic  continental  crust  due  to  its  association  with  TTG,  calc-alkaline 
plutonism (Klein and Moura., 2009). Following this, other cratonic blocks  which formed in 
the  same  way,  collided  with  the  accreted  arcs  to  form  orogenic  belts  and  the  closure  of  an 
oceanic basin. The Eburnean Orogeny is an example of this process (Hirdes et al., 1996; Hein 
et al., 2004; Feybesse et al., 2006). The OGGB is one of the island arc terranes, and the east

2011_Peters_East Markoye_2011.txt,town of Markoye,"21,6","2.2. Location and Physiography 
The study area is situated approximately 2 km east of the town of Markoye and is located 12 
km west of the international border of Niger and 38 km south of the border of Mali (Fig. 2). The town of Markoye is located at the divide between the Sahel and the Sahara; everything 
north of the town is considered to be the Sahara Desert. Thus, the field area is an arid and hot 
environment with much of the surface covered with sand and loose gravels making outcrop 
difficult to find in the low-lying areas. The areas of high relief however, are desert mountains 
that contain a large amount of rock which, unfortunately, was dominated by  loose boulders 
and very little in situ-outcrop. || 5.0. Lithologies 
The geology of the study area consists of metamorphosed and folded sedimentary sequences 
as well as igneous intrusions. The geology is best expressed on ridges to the east and south-
east of the town of Markoye. In-situ outcrop is difficult to locate because approximately 95 % 
of the exposed rock mass is made up of dislodged boulders and blocks (Figs. 6 a & b). This 
made  retrieving  accurate  measurements  difficult.",llm,PLACE,14.7095001,0.0948661,"Markoye, Oudalan, Sahel, Burkina Faso",APPROXIMATE

dated at 250 Ma. Tshibubudze et al. (2009) classified dolerite dykes with the same trend in
