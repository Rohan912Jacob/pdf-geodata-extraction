ABSTRACT 
The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. 
Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts.  Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. 
The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. The volcanic facies were 
established through field and petrographic interpretations. The subaqueous facies architecture consists 
of proximal, coherent and autoclastic basaltic flow units containing porphyritic, aphyric, amygdaloidal 
and hyaloclastic textures as well as pillowed, jointed and flow-banded basaltic lithofacies. Proximal to 
distal volcanogenic manganese deposits intercalated with basalt flows indicate a syn-volcanic genesis. 
A  discrete  pyroclastic  interbed  (~300  m  thick)  within  a  volcanogenic,  marginal  marine  to  offshore 
greywacke succession occupies a distal facies relative to the volcanic source and indicates a bimodal 
source of volcanism, i.e., mafic and intermediate. 
Volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  are  characterized  by  quartz-ankerite  stockwork  breccia,  a 
braunite-ilmenite-magnetite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-(gold)  mineral  assemblage  and 
increased  Ba 
concentrations,  indicating  syn-volcanic  seafloor-related  hydrothermal  activity.  The  Goren  volcano-
sedimentary  belt  presents potential for  economic  mineralisation  in  volcanogenic  primary  manganese 
and base metal deposits.

LIST OF FIGURES 
Figure  1.1.  Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern 
Ghana. Volcano-sedimentary belts from the northeast Burkina Faso are modified after Hein et 
al.  (2004);  the  study  area  is  located  in  the  Goren  belt  and  expanded  in  Inset  A.  Location  of 
Tiebélé  dome  of  southern  Burkina  Faso  with  Zn  anomalies  as  defined  by  Ilboudo  (2010)  is 
presented in Inset B. The Perkoa and Gaoua deposits are located in the Boromo belt in Burkina 
Faso, southwest of Ouagadougou. The Essakane, Falagountou, Taparko and Inata goldfields are 
represented in north-northeast of Burkina Faso. The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the 
Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The 
Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt. 
Figure 2.1. The Goren volcano-sedimentary belt is presented showing the locations of Kaya, Mané, 
Guilla, Korsimoro, Sirgui artisanal mine and Tangapella hill. Northwest and northeast trending 
shears  and  thrusts  are  represented  as  well  as  WNW  trending  shears  of  the  Wabo-Tampelse 
Event. A variety of granodiorite intrusions are shown including the Pissila batholith and Loudo 
granodiorite that crop out to the east of the Goren belt. The Silimidougou megacrystic granite 
crops out to the west of the Goren belt. This image is modified after Hein et al. (2004) and Hein 
(2010). 
Figure  3.1.  Geological  map  of  the  southern  Goren  belt  presenting  rock  types,  major  structures, 
infrastructure and geochemical sample points. 
Figure 3.2. Volcanic facies map of the southern Goren belt representing the location of various facies 
and major structures. Two schematic section lines, A-B and C-D, are drawn. 
Figure 4.1. Photograph of plagioclase crystals in porphyritic basalt (rare) demonstrating preferential 
weathering. Crystals measure 1.5 cm in length. 
Figure 4.2. (a) Photograph of pillows in a hyaloclastic breccia (Pi = Pillow; Hy = Hyaloclastite) where 
the hyaloclastic breccia is observed in the inter-pillow domains (Sample G12-02-110, UTM 30P 
694964;  1440271).  Pillows  are  20-30  cm  with  chill  margins  less  than  1  cm  thick.  (b) 
Photograph of amygdaloidal pillowed basalt with amygdales concentrated on the pillow margins 
compared  to  the  centre  of  the  pillow  (Sample  G12-008,  UTM  30P  694317;  1443450).  The 
amygdales  are  elongate  toward  the  margin  of  the  pillow  and  measure  2  cm  in  length.  (c) 
Photograph  of  hyaloclastic  pillow  basalt  displaying  an  ~10  cm  pillow  with  well-defined 
amygdale accumulation on the margin of the pillow, with hyaloclastic breccia enclosing it. 
Figure  4.3.  (a)  Photograph  of  pillowed  basalt  that  has  undergone  flattening  (Station  point  G12-02-
083; UTM 30P 703920; 1446075). Re-entrants and rinds are still visible. Stratigraphic facing is 
to the north. (b) Photograph of a basalt with vertical fractures that are interpreted to be the result 
of cooling (Station point G12-02-004; UTM 30P 703585; 1426248). (c) Photograph of tortoise 
8

shell jointing in basalt that is interpreted to be the result of cooling (Sample G12-02-095; UTM 
30P 695421; 1443258). Polygonal jointing is fairly well-defined. 
Figure 4.4. (a) Photograph of flow banding in a basalt (Station point G12-02-098; UTM 30P 693240; 
1443462).  The  flow  bands  were  identified  by  light  and  dark  banding  that  is  interpreted  to  be 
caused by differential mineral accumulation. (b, c) Photographs of hyaloclastic basalt interstitial 
to  loosely  packed  pillowed  basalt  (Station  point  G12-02-099;  UTM  30P  696917;  1441719). 
Various  shapes  result  from  fragmentation  of  the  basalt  and  stand  proud  due  to  differential 
weathering. 
Figure 4.5. (a) Photographs of siltstone showing well-defined Fe-rich and Fe-poor laminations (G12-
02014; UTM 30P 711294; 1431532). Bed thicknesses range from 1 mm to 5 cm. Micro-faults 
crosscut  the  siltstone.  The  siltstone  exhibits  well  developed  cleavage  planes,  particularly 
prominent in the Fe-rich layers. (b) Photograph of a fining upward greywacke succession with 
thin monomictic conglomerate interbeds making up the basal unit of Bouma sequences (G12-
02-119; UTM 30P 708845; 1431001). The basal layer of Unit 2 is composed of coarse-grained 
gritstone  compared  to  the  conglomerate  layer  of  Unit  1.  The  depositional  environment  is 
interpreted  as  a  marginal  marine-offshore  setting.  (c)  Photograph  of  a  poorly  sorted 
volcanogenic  greywacke  deposit  with  angular  fragments.  The  greywacke  is  composed  of 
rounded  chert  clasts  and  is  matrix-supported  (Station  point  G12-02-010;  UTM  30P  696828; 
1443986).  (d)  Photograph  of  a  polylithic,  poorly  sorted,  massive  volcanogenic  greywacke 
(Sample G12-02-093, UTM 30P 709616; 1429270). The angular fragments measure up to 3 cm 
in size. 
Figure 4.6. (a-b) Photograph of a polylithic, non-bedded, lapilli-bomb dominated pyroclastic breccia 
deposit  with  angular  to  sub-angular  crystals  of  ilmenite,  magnetite,  plagioclase,  quartz  and 
hornblende,  ranging  in  size  from  2  mm  to  7  cm  (Sample  G12-02-126,  UTM  30P  709365; 
1424791). 
Figure  5.1.  (a)  Photomicrograph  of  basalt  exhibiting  subhedral  plagioclase  microlites,  a  largely 
replaced  groundmass,  and  an  amygdale  containing  chlorite  and  subhedral  zeolite  crystals 
(Sample G12-009; plane polarized light). (b) Photomicrograph of a microlitic basalt containing 
< 1.5 mm euhedral plagioclase microlites, anhedral ilmenite (opaque), interstitial quartz and a 
high  proportion  of  chlorite  (Sample  G12-009;  UTM  30P  693302;  1444147;  plane  polarized 
light).  (c)  Photomicrograph  of  a  porphyritic  basalt  with  0.5-1.0  mm  partly  altered  plagioclase 
crystals.  The  groundmass  is  composed  of  chlorite  and  epidote,  which  is  interpreted  to  be  the 
result  of  plagioclase  and  clinopyroxene  microlite  alteration  (G12-018;  UTM  30P  695652; 
1466804).  (d)  Photomicrograph  of  an  amygdale  in  amygdaloidal  basalt.  The  amygdale  is 
interpreted  to  form  due  to  passive  degassing  of  the  basaltic  liquid  and  these  are  filled  with 
various  minerals  at  a  later  stage.  In  this  case,  the  infill  is  with  epidote  and  zeolite  group 
minerals.  The  amygdale  exhibits  a  sub-rounded  shape  in  which  the  zeolite  crystals  radiate 
9

inward from the amygdale boundary toward a fine-grained aggregate of epidote (Sample G12-
02-057; UTM 30P 699990; 1435556; cross polarized light). 
Figure  5.2.  (a)  Photomicrograph  of  a  medium  grained,  amygdaloidal  basalt  that  displays  a  partly 
chloritised amygdale filled with devitrified glass. The amygdale is rimmed by zeolites. Smaller 
amygdales in  the  image  are  also  filled  with  chlorite and  zeolite (G12-02-096;  plane  polarized 
light.  (b,  c)  Photomicrographs  of  hyaloclastic  basalt  (1:1  scale)  that  is  altered  to  chlorite-
actinolite. The hyaloclastite is brecciated in a jigsaw of basalt fragments. The breccia matrix is 
composed  of  chloritised  volcanic  glass.  Late  stage  epidote  veins  crosscut  the  hyaloclastic 
breccia  (G12-02-099;  UTM  30P  696917;  1441719  and  G12-02-057;  UTM  30P  699990; 
1435556; plane polarized light). 
Figure 5.3. (a) Photomicrograph of a medium-grained basalt composed of metamorphic mineralogy. 
The  image  exhibits  well-formed,  <  3.5  mm  epidote  crystals  surrounded  by  a  fine-grained 
epidote and chlorite (Sample G12-02-096; UTM 30P 694686; 1443104; cross polarized light). 
(b)  Photomicrograph  of  a  basalt  that  displays  plagioclase  with  an  overprint  of  epidote  and 
chlorite.  Plagioclase  is  partly  replaced  by  chlorite,  but  retains  it  lath-like  shape,  is  randomly 
oriented  and  exhibits  albite  twinning  (Sample  G12-02-095;  UTM  30P  695421;  1443258).  (c) 
Photomicrograph  of  basalt  that  is  crosscut  by  a  quartz-calcite  vein.  The  basalt  is  altered  to 
chlorite-epidote  but  retrains  minor  primary  plagioclase  microlites.  The  vein  crosscuts  both 
primary and secondary mineralogies indicating it formed syn- or post-alteration. (Sample G12-
02-095;  cross  polarized  light).  (d)  Photomicrograph  of  pyrite  and  chalcopyrite  in  a  vein  that 
crosscuts  basalt  (Sample  G12-02-096;  UTM  30P  694686;  1443104;  Reflected-light).  The 
texture indicates that sulphide mineralisation is synchronous to, or postdates emplacement of the 
basalt sequence. 
Figure  5.4.  (a)  Photomicrographs  of  a  coarse-grained,  poorly  sorted,  chlorite-rich  volcanogenic 
greywacke.  The  sample  is  composed  of  quartz,  plagioclase  (>  2mm),  lithic  chert  clasts,  and 
biotite  (Sample  G12-007;  696828;  1443986).  (b,  c)  Photomicrographs  of  pyroclastic  breccia 
containing  euhedral,  coarse-grained  (>  1mm)  plagioclase,  chert,  quartz  and  fine-grained  (< 
0.5mm)  epidote  replacing  clinopyroxene  and  hornblende.  The  matrix  is  interpreted  to  be 
composed of ash-lapilli sized fragments that are altered to epidote and chlorite (Sample G12-02-
126;  UTM  30P  709365;  1424791,  cross  polarized  light).  (d)  Photomicrograph  of  pyroclastic 
breccia  that  is  composed  of  euhedral,  coarse-grained  (>  1  mm),  zoned,  volcanic  hornblende, 
with well-defined cleavage, and l> 2 mm sub-rounded chert clasts and sub-angular quartz grains 
(Sample G12-02-126; UTM 30P 709365; 1424791, plane polarized light). 
Figure 5.5. (a) Photomicrograph of tabular, colloform and brecciated braunite from a Mn-Fe-rich unit 
(Sample  G12-004;  UTM  30P  702744;  1446079,  reflected light). The three  texture  of  braunite 
suggest different growth phases. Late stage fractures cross-cut brecciated braunite and terminate 
against the tabular braunite indicating that tabular braunite developed after the colloform texture 
10

braunite.  (b)  Photomicrograph  of  a  Mn-Fe-rich,  carbonaceous  unit  which  is  crosscut  by 
anastomosing  hematite  veins  (Sample  G12-02-080;  UTM  30P  703512;  1444037,  reflected 
light).  (c)  Photomicrograph  of  a  Mn-Fe-rich  unit  that  are  crosscut  by  ilmenite-bearing  veins. 
The  ilmenite,  in this case, is interpreted as  a  secondary  phase because it  is  vein-hosted  in the 
rocks (Sample G12-02-35; UTM 30P 707346; 1425026, reflected light). (d) Photomicrograph of 
a Mn-Fe carbonaceous unit that is crosscut by stockwork quartz ± ankerite veins. The rock is 
altered  to  hematite,  ilmenite,  magnetite  and  secondary  quartz  (sample  G12-017;  UTM  30P 
677996; 1466647, plane polarized light). 
Figure 5.6. (a) Photomicrograph of a chalcostibite in dolerite. Chalcostibite forms large, disseminated 
crystals.  The  chalcostibite  crystals  are  soft  (shown  by  scratches),  contain  triangular  pits,  and 
have a moderate reflection (Sample G12-02-122; UTM 30P 709363; 1425384, reflected light). 
(b) Photomicrograph of an aplite dyke, which is composed of medium to coarse microcline and 
quartz,  with  subordinate  muscovite.  The  mineralogy  is  unaltered  (Sample  G12-02-114;  UTM 
30P 711540; 1432977, cross polarized light). 
Figure 6.1. (a) Streckeisen classification diagram for volcanic rocks plots the rocks from the GB as 
basalts, basalt-andesite to dacite in composition. The samples that indicate dacitic composition 
contain  increased  secondary  silica, interpreted  to  be  a  result  of  silicification.  (b)  Nb/Y  versus 
Zr/TiO2 x 0.0001 diagram (after Winchester and Floyd, 1976). The GB volcanic rocks generally 
plot  in  the  basalt  field.  (c)  Le  Maitre’s  classification  for  volcanic  rocks.  The  GB  rocks  plot 
within the basalt, basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts 
are distributed throughout the basalt, basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. The Tiebélé samples 
have a smaller SiO2 range but some samples contain increased alkali concentrations and plot as 
trachyandesite and tephrite. The Oudalan-Gorouol belt samples plot between basalt and basaltic-
andesite.  (d)  SiO2  versus K2O  (wt%) demonstrates  that the  GB  volcanic rocks  plot  within the 
Low-K series for the most part. One sample plots in the Medium-K series with a K2O value of 
~1 wt%. Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts plot within the Low-K series as well as the 
calc-alkaline fields (Medium-K, High-K series and the Shoshonite series. The Tiebélé samples 
vary between the different fields. (e) The AFM diagram plots samples from various locations. 
The  GB  volcanic  rocks  plot  in  the  tholeiitic  phase  whereas  the  Boromo-Houndé  samples  are 
split between tholeiitic  and  calc-alkaline  compositions  which  agrees  with  classifications  made 
by  Baratoux et  al.  (2011). The Tiebélé  samples  are also  distributed  between calc-alkaline  and 
tholeiitic compositions. 
Figure 6.2. Harker diagrams exhibiting crystallization trends of major elements for the GB volcanic 
rocks. Red dots=more deformed samples; blue dots=less deformed samples (a) The MgO-NiO 
plot resolved a trend line in which NiO decreased with MgO. This suggests the crystallization of 
clinopyroxene  occurred,  which  consumed  Ni  thus  removing  it  from  the  melt  to  the  crystal 
structure.  The  slight  shallowing  of  the  NiO-MgO  trend  line  is  due  to  the  closure  of 
11

--- Page 12 ---
clinopyroxene crystallization (b) The MgO-Cr2O3 plot resolved a similar trend in which Cr2O3 
decreased in wt% as MgO decreased. The decrease of Cr2O3 was credited to the crystallization 
of spinel and clinopyroxene. The trend shallowed, indicating less Cr was used up, caused by a 
decrease  or  halt  in  spinel  and  clinopyroxene  crystallization  (c,  d)  The  MgO-CaO  and  MgO-
Al2O3  plots  exhibited  directly  proportional  trends.  As  MgO  decreased,  it  was  interpreted  that 
CaO  and  Al2O3  decrease  as  plagioclase  crystallised  (e,  f)  MgO-SiO2  and  MgO-TiO2  plots 
resolved similar trends. At high MgO values, there are low concentrations of SiO2 and TiO2. As 
the melt began to evolve and fractionate, the concentration of SiO2 and TiO2 increased. TiO2 will 
crystallise  and  form  oxide  minerals  such  as  rutile  and  ilmenite  (g)  The  MgO-Na2O  plot 
displayed  the  Na2O  concentration  increasing  slowly  as  MgO  concentration  remained high.  As 
the MgO concentration began to decrease, the Na2O concentration rapidly increased. This can 
be explained by the crystallization of the Na-rich end-members of plagioclase, towards the end 
of crystallization (h) The MgO-P2O5 plot also resolved an increasing trend as MgO decreased, 
suggesting  phosphorus  did  not  crystallise  (i)  The  MgO-FeO  plot  resolved  an  increasing  FeO 
trend. It would be expected at some point in the fractionation process for Fe to partition into Fe-
oxide  minerals,  explaining  the  decrease  in  FeO  concentrations.  (j)  K2O  versus  MgO  shows  a 
poor correlation.  
Figure 6.3 (a) Chondrite-normalised multi-element diagram comparing the tholeiitic basalts from the 
GB,  Boromo-Houndé  belts  and  the  Tiebélé  region.  The  sample  suites  contain  similar  trace 
element  affinities  indicated  by  similar  patterns.  Rb  exhibits  a  negative  anomaly  ranging  from 
0.1to 5 times the chondritic value. Similarly, Ti displays a negative anomaly ranging from 0.5 to 
times  that  of  chondrite.  (b)  Chondrite-normalised  multi-element  diagram  comparing  the 
tholeiitic basalts of the GB with the calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of the Boromo-Houndé belts. 
The Boromo-Houndé data present enrichment in Rb, Ba, Th, U, La, Ce, Pr, Sr and Nd relative 
to  the  GB  samples. This  indicates  that  calc-alkaline rocks  are  more  enriched  in  LIL  elements 
relative  to  tholeiitic  compositions.  Both  sample  suites  have  similar  concentrations  for  the 
remaining elements. 
Figure 6.4. (a) Chondrite-normalised multi-element diagram comparing the tholeiitic basalts from the 
GB,  Boromo-Houndé  belts  and  the  Tiebélé  region.  Similar  patterns  indicate  similar  trace 
element properties for the tholeiitic basalt samples from three regions. On this element array, Rb 
and Ti display negative anomalies. P exhibits a large, negative anomaly (~twice the size of Ti) 
with values ranging from ~0.03-0.5 that of chondrite. (b) Chondrite-normalised multi-element 
diagram comparing the tholeiitic basalts from the GB with the calc-alkaline volcanic rocks from 
the  Boromo-Houndé  belts.  An  enrichment  in  the  calc-alkaline  rocks  is  presented  for  Ba  to  P 
relative  to  the  GB  samples.  Ba,  Rb  and  Th  show  a  relative  enrichment  of  one  order  of 
magnitude  indicating  significantly  different  trace  element  chemistry  for  the  sample  suites. 
Although the sample suites are compositionally different, the P anomaly is present throughout 
12

--- Page 13 ---
both  plots,  albeit  the  anomaly  is  smaller  for  the  calc-alkaline  volcanic  rocks.  (c)  Primitive 
mantle normalised multi-element diagram with a chemical array used in McCuaig et al. (1994) 
that presents negative P and Ti anomalies. These anomalies are interpreted to form because of 
phosphorus and titanium retention in silicate minerals in the magma source region. 
Figure 6.5. (a) N-MORB normalised multi-element (after Tarney et al., 1981) diagram presenting the 
data from the GB. The elemental array increases in incompatibility from left to right. Ta and P 
are  removed  from  the  x-axis.  The  data  represents  a  similarity  between  the  GB  rocks  and  the 
average N-type MORB concentrations. A range in concentrations exists but they do not deviate 
significantly from the N-MORB values. Rb and Cr have the widest range of concentrations (~1-
20 and ~1-0.05 the value of N-MORB) and Y portrays a negative anomaly, consistent with each 
sample. (b) N-MORB normalised multi-element diagram (after Tarney et al., 1981) comparing 
the  GB  tholeiitic  basalts  to  the  Boromo-Houndé  calc-alkaline  volcanic  rocks.  Ta  and  P  are 
added  to  the  x-axis.  The  GB  tholeiitic  basalts  present  large  Ta  and  P  anomalies,  positive  and 
negative, respectively. The calc-alkaline rocks present negative Ti and P anomalies. 
Figure 6.6. (a) Chondrite-normalised REE patterns for the GB tholeiitic basalts. The data presents a 
flat  overall  pattern  from  LREE  to  HREE  and  are  considered typical  of  tholeiitic  MORB.  The 
average range in concentrations for LREE is from ~8-25 times the chondritic value, whereas the 
HREE range between ~9 and 20 times chondrite. Some samples present slight depletions, while 
others present slight enrichments from LREE to HREE. (b) Chondrite-normalised REE diagram 
comparing  the  GB,  Boromo-Houndé  and  Tiebélé  tholeiitic  basalts.  The  REE  patterns  of  each 
sample  suite  present  parallel  patterns  of  similar  magnitudes.  The  Tiebélé  samples  present  a 
slightly  decreasing  trend  from  LREE  to  HREE.  (c)  Chondrite-normalised  REE  diagram 
comparing tholeiitic basalts from the GB to the Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline volcanic rocks. 
The calc-alkaline rocks present enrichment in LREE relative to HREE compared to the tholeiitic 
compositions,  resulting  in  a  decreasing  trend.  Boromo-Houndé  calc-alkaline  volcanic  rocks 
have La values range from ~30-80 time chondrite and Lu between ~6 and 12 times chondrite. 
Negative Eu anomalies are present. 
Figure  6.7.  (a)  Ternary  discrimination  diagram  (Ti/100,  Zr  and  Yx3).  The  data  is  clustered  within 
field B and A, indicating most of the GB volcanic rocks are MORB, island arc tholeiite or calc-
alkaline basalt. Two outliers, although clustered with the data, do not plot in a tectonic field. (b) 
Binary  discrimination  diagram  that  plots  Zr  versus Ti  (ppm).  A  good  correlation  between  the 
data is presented. The GB volcanic rocks plot in fields B and D, representing MORB, calc-alkali 
basalts and island arc tholeiites; therefore no definitive tectonic setting can be established from 
this graph. (c) A ternary discrimination diagram (2Nb, Y and Zr/4 ) that follows from Figure 6.7 
b.  The  GB  samples  plot  well  within  field  D.  Field  D  categorizes  the  data  either  as  N-type 
MORB or volcanic-arc basalts. The data represents a linear trend, becoming more enriched in Zr 
and Nb or Y.

geochemistry. The dotted line indicates the concentrations that are expected across the tectonic

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Preamble 
Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991).  Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). 
The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in 
Ghana  (Kitson,  1918)  and  were  classified  as  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  lavas.  This  bimodal 
volcanic  suite  was  also  described  by  Abouchami  et  al.  (1990)  in  craton-wide  studies  that  concluded 
that tholeiitic suites were more abundant than calc-alkaline suites (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher et 
al., 1992; Pouclet et al., 1996; Arndt et al., 1997; Lompo, 2009). Mg-rich tholeiites and calc-alkaline 
lavas  were  also  described  by  Dia  et  al.  (1997)  from  the  Kénieba-Kédougou  Inlier  of  western  Mali. 
Blanchot et al. (1972), Béssoles (1977), Wright (1985), Abouchami et al. (1990), Leube et al. (1990) 
and others established that a volcanic sequence defined a basal succession to an overlying sedimentary 
sequence in volcano-sedimentary belts throughout the WAC. 
Additionally,  studies  of  the  volcano-sedimentary  belts  by  Dia  (1988),  Lüdtke  et  al.  (1998), 
Béziat  et  al.  (2000)  and  Dampare  et  al.  (2008)  concluded  that  tholeiitic  and  calc-alkaline  volcanic 
rocks  are  characteristic  of  juvenile  volcanic  arcs.  The  tholeiitic  basalts  were  interpreted  as 
stratigraphically  younger  than  the  calc-alkaline  sequences  (Dia,  1988;  Lüdtke  et  al.,  1998;  Béziat  et 
al., 2000; Dampare et al., 2008; Baratoux et al., 2011). Pouclet et al. (1996), Arndt et al. (1997) and 
Lompo (2009) proposed that the basaltic sequences were represent oceanic plateaus that were derived 
from  mantle  plume  activity,  but  Leube  et  al.  (1990)  and  Pouclet  et  al.  (1996)  concluded  that  they 
formed in an intra-continental rift setting that evolved into an accretionary arc. Vidal and Alric (1994) 
interpreted that the basaltic sequences were the product of back-arc basin volcanism. 
Pouclet et al. (1996) and Hirdes et al. (1996) described two major periods of volcanism for the 
WAC from two discrete but juxtaposed volcano-(sedimentary) belts in northeast Cote d’Ivoire;  
(1)  an  eastern  belt  is  composed  of  basaltic  and  pyroclastic-dominated  volcanic  rocks  that  were 
emplaced  at  approximately  2185-2150  Ma  (U-Pb  zircon).  The  volcanic  rocks  are  widespread  in 
Ghana, eastern Cote d’Ivoire and eastern Burkina Faso (WAXI, 2013).

Figure  1.1.  Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern  Ghana.  Volcano-
sedimentary  belts  from  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso  are  modified after  Hein  et  al.  (2004);  the  study  area  is  located  in  the 
Goren belt and expanded in Inset A. Location of Tiebélé dome of southern Burkina Faso with Zn anomalies as defined by 
Ilboudo  (2010)  is  presented  in  Inset  B.  The  Perkoa  and  Gaoua  deposits  are  located  in  the  Boromo  belt  in  Burkina  Faso, 
southwest of Ouagadougou. The Essakane, Falagountou, Taparko and Inata goldfields are represented in north-northeast of 
Burkina Faso. The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt.

(2)  a  western  belt  in  central  Cote  d'Ivoire,  western  Mali  and  Guinea,  essentially  composed  of  the 
equivalent volcanic products but geochronologically younger at approximately 2105 Ma (U-Pb zircon) 
(Hirdes et al., 1996). 
Despite  these  investigations,  surprisingly  little  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  volcanic 
sequences  at  the  scale  of  one  or  several  belts  in  West  Africa.  Few  studies  have  been  conducted  on 
volcanic facies and metal potential in terms of base metals and Mn mineralisation, but delineating the 
volcanic facies and alteration zones  of volcanic belts can help in identifying and targeting volcanic-
related mineral deposits. For example, the Mount Reid volcanics in western Tasmania and the Abitibi 
greenstone  belt  of  central  Canada  are  both  regions  where  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide 
mineralization  has  been  found.  Their  volcanic  facies  and  alteration  zones  are  well  understood, 
providing spatial constraints to economic mineralization (McPhie et al., 1993; Piché and Jébrak 2006). 
Delineating facies is also important in developing tectonic models for volcanic terranes. Distal 
versus proximal facies and coherent versus volcaniclastic facies can be interpreted using lithological 
relationships, volcanic textures and rock composition. For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern 
Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano-
sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with 
Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were 
leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and 
concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative 
processes took place during eruption. 
Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the 
same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be 
juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner.  However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology, 
sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic 
environment.  
This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1) 
where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are 
intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe  
bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010). The belt is weakly to moderately metamorphosed, giving 
a  unique  opportunity  to study  relatively  pristine  volcanic textures and  establish  volcanic  facies. The 
volcano-sedimentary  units  have  been  mapped,  sampled  in  detail  and  analysed  both  petrographically 
and  geochemically.  From  field  studies,  geological  and  volcanic  facies  maps  were  created.  This 
information  has  been  used  to  interpret  volcanic  setting.  The  metallogenic  potential  of  the  southern 
Goren volcano-sedimentary belt has also been assessed in this study.

1.2. Location and physiography 
Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger 
and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the 
Sahel climatic zone.  
The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions.  Burkina  Faso  has  an  average 
daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and 
northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely 
the wet and dry seasons. The dry season occurs from October to May, which is followed by the wet 
season from June until September (Bierschenk, 1968; McFarland et al., 1998). 
Geographically,  the  capital  city  of  Ouagadougou  is  situated  at  the  centre  of  the  country.  The 
Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  located  in  the  Sanmatenga  district.  The  belt  is  elongate  and 
northwest-trending and extends from the towns of Kaya to Kongossi (Figure 1.1). The town of Kaya is 
approximately 90 km northeast of Ouagadougou and lies at the southeastern end of the belt. Kongossi 
is 60 km from Kaya and lies at the northeastern end of the belt. The belt is composed of two 100 km 
parallel  branches  that  are  characterized  by  topographic  highs;  the  branches  are  separated  by  a 
relatively flat lying region up to 20 km wide. 
An extensive ferricrete profile covers the GB as is typical for the West African craton in general 
(Brown  et  al.,  1994;  Beauvais  et  al.,  2008).  The  ferricrete  formed  during  the  Cretaceous  Period  but 
was remobilised during the Palaeogene-Neogene in discrete erosion events, with 40Ar/39Ar dates of 59-
45 Ma, 29-18 Ma, 18-11 Ma, 6 Ma and 3 Ma (Brown et al., 1994; Beauvais et al., 2008). The last three 
erosional  periods  were  responsible  for  the  formation  of  distinct  three-level  pediment  surfaces  seen 
throughout the GB (WAXI, 2013). 
1.3. Project aims 
The aims of this project include: 
(1) To map the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt and to create both lithological and volcanic 
facies maps. 
(2)  To  identify  and  classify  the  volcanic  rocks  within  the  field  area  according  to  volcanic  texture, 
volcanic facies, mineralogy and chemistry. 
(3)  To  determine  an  original  volcanic/tectonic  setting  using  the  composition,  volcanic  textures  and 
volcanic facies of volcanic and associated sedimentary rocks. 
(4)  To  assess  the  exploration  potential  for  mineralisation  within  the  volcanic  or  meta-sedimentary 
rocks, specifically base metal sulphides and manganese.

1.6. Limitations of the study 
A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political 
instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were 
restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against 
unnecessary  travel.  The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area.  However,  a 
comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano-
sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study.

2. REVIEW OF WEST AFRICAN GEOLOGY 
2.1. Stratigraphy 
The West African Craton (WAC) is made up of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks and is 
divided  into  the  Reguibat  Rise  in  the  north  and  the  Leo-Man  Rise  in  the  south  (Thiéblemont  et  al., 
2004)  (Figure  1.1).  The  Leo-Man  consists  of  two  domains,  namely  the  Archaean  Kénema-Man 
domain  (3.54  Ga)  in  the  southwest  and the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (2.3-1.8  Ga)  in 
the  east  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006),  with  the  exception  of  the  Kénieba-  Kédougou  and  Kayes  Inliers, 
located  between  Mali  and  Senegal  (Figure  1.1).  The  Birimian  Supergroup  makes  up  part  of  the 
Baoulé-Mossi  domain  and  was  deposited  ca.  2.3  Ga  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006). 
Deposition  was  followed  by  local  micro-plate  accretion  during  the Tangaean  Event  at  2.17-2.15  Ga 
(Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009;  Hein,  2010;  Baratoux  et  al.,  2011; Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  2013;  WAXI, 
2013) and the polycyclic Eburnean Orogeny at approximately 2.14-2.05 Ga (Milési et al., 1991, 1992; 
Boher et al., 1992; Taylor et al., 1992; WAXI, 2013). The Tarkwa Group unconformably overlies the 
Birimian Supergroup and is characterized by conglomerate, quartzite and shale units, but does not crop 
out  in  the  study  area.  The  Tarkwa  Group  is  interpreted  to  be  the  erosional  product  of  the  Birimian 
Supergroup and was intruded by various TTG suite plutons and deformed by the Eburnean Orogeny 
(Hastings, 1982; Leube et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1992; Castaing et al., 2003). 
The  stratigraphy  of  the  WAC  was  originally  established  by  Junner  (1935),  who  identified 
dacitic/rhyodacitic  volcaniclastic,  greywacke,  shale  and  chemical  sedimentary  units  in  what  was 
termed  the  lower  Birimian.  Leube  et  al.  (1990)  identified  tholeiitic  basalts  (intercalated  with 
volcaniclastic  sequences)  as  the  upper  Birimian.  The  tholeiitic  basalt  and  volcaniclastic  sequences 
formed  at  the  same  time  in  local  sedimentary  basins.  Junner  (1935;  1940),  Ledru  et  al.  (1991),  and 
Milési et al. (1989, 1991) interpreted that the volcanic sequences were younger than the sedimentary 
basins.  However,  Hein  et  al.  (2004)  and  Hein  (2010)  concluded  that  the  volcanic  and  meta-
sedimentary  rocks  formed  part  of  an  intercalated  sequence.  Baratoux  et  al.  (2011)  argued  that  the 
sedimentary  basins  in  western  Burkina  Faso  exhibited  complicated  strato-structural  relationships, 
making it difficult to establish local stratigraphy. However, recent studies by WAXI (2013) concluded 
that the stratigraphy of the WAC is dependent on the spatial and temporal distribution of belts relative 
to accretionary terranes. 
Importantly, a detailed stratigraphic study was conducted by Baratoux et al. (2011) across three 
greenstone  belts  in  western  Burkina  Faso  (namely  the  Boromo,  Houndé  and  Banfora  belts)  (Figure 
1.1).  Their  study  confirmed  that  the  belts  are  composed  of  calc-alkaline  andesite  and  dacite, 
intercalated  tuff  layers,  pyroclastic  flows,  Mn-Fe    rich  chert  layers  and  volcaniclastic  sedimentary 
rocks  that  overlie  basal  units  of  tholeiitic basalt. The  study  clearly  showed  that  tholeiitic  basalts  are 
22

--- Page 23 ---
older  than  the  calc-alkaline  series  of  lavas  for  the  Boromo,  Houndé  and  Banfora  belts.  However, 
craton-wide studies by WAXI (2013) indicated that the stratigraphic order of volcanic rocks cannot be 
generalised  (some  belts  do  not  host  tholeiitic  and/or  calc-alkaline  volcanic  rocks)  and  thus  the 
stratigraphy of each greenstone belt must be established independently. 
2.2. Granitoid and dolerite emplacement 
The emplacement of tonalite-trondjemite-granodiorite (TTG) plutons and granites in the WAC 
is restricted to 2200, 2160-2130 and 2100-2070 Ma according to Pawlig et al. (2006) and Gueye et al. 
(2008).  The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG 
granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006; 
Vidal  et  al.,  2009).  TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013).  The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. 
(Drummond and Defant, 1990). 
In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). 
A swarm of WNW and NW-trending dolerite dykes crosscut the WAC including the GB. They 
are genarlly composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene and magnetite and are currently dated at 215 ± 15 
Ma (K-Ar whole-rock age) (Hottin and Ouedraogo, 1992). 
2.3. Metamorphism and deformation 
The Birimian Supergroup in northern Burkina Faso underwent deformation during the Tangaean 
Event (2170-2150 Ma) (Tshibubudze et al., 2009; Hein, 2010; Tshibubudze and Hein, 2013) as well as 
craton-wide deformation associated with regional metamorphism during the Eburnean Orogeny (2145-
2100 Ma) (Hein et al., 2004;  Feybesse et al., 2006; Hein, 2010;  Baratoux et al., 2011; Tshibubudze 
and Hein, 2013; WAXI, 2013), and deformation during the Wabo-Tampelse Event (undated) (Hein et 
al., 2004; Hein, 2010; Baratoux et al., 2011). Metamorphic grades during the Tangaean reached lower 
23

--- Page 24 ---
greenschist facies at most (WAXI, 2013). Regional metamorphism in the Eburnean Orogeny attained 
greenschist  facies  (Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1991;  Bossière  et  al.,  1996;  Hirdes  et  al.,  1996)  with  the 
development of chlorite, muscovite, epidote and actinolite mineral assemblages, and low to medium 
grade amphibolite facies with the introduction of hornblende (Bossière et al., 1996; Béziat et al., 2000; 
Debat et al., 2003; Naba et al., 2004). Granulite facies metamorphic rocks  crop out in the Oudalan-
Gorouol belt on the margin of the Dori batholith in the Gorom Gorom region (Tshibubudze and Hein, 
2013), and in the Pissila batholith in the Saaba region (Simoko, 2012). 
Three deformation events are recognised in northeast Burkina Faso: 
(1)  D1  (Tangaean  Event)  resulted  in  NW-trending  dextral  reverse  shear  zones,  folds  and  an  S1 
foliation.  The  shortening  direction  was  SW-directed  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009;  Hein,  2010; 
Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  2013).  D1  is  recognised  in  northern  Ghana  by  de  Kock  et  al.  (2011)  and 
southern Ghana by Perrouty et al. (2012) as the Eoeburnean (WAXI, 2013). 
(2) D2 is characterized by NNE-NE trending shears, folds and an S2 foliation parallel to axial planes 
of the folds, caused by NW-SE compression which is defined by the Eburnean Orogeny (Milési et al., 
1989; Feybesse et al., 2006; Hein, 2010; Baratoux et al., 2011). 
(3) D3 is characterized by WNW trending shears and folds. An associated S3 foliation formed during 
N-S  compression.  This  event  is  termed  the  Wabo-Tampelse  Event  (Hein  et  al.,  2004;  Hein,  2010; 
Baratoux et al., 2011). 
2.4. Metallogenesis 
Metallogenesis in the northeast of Burkina Faso includes gold, diamonds,  Mn-Fe, silver, lead, 
molybdenum,  copper  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1992;  Hein  et  al.,  2004; 
Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009).  In  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  belt,  manganese  deposits  occur  at  Tambão  and 
Billiata  (Figure  1.1)  and  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  the  Tin  Edia  deposit.  Gold  occurrences 
include  commercially  mined  goldfields  such  as  Essakane,  Inata  and  Taparko  goldfields,  as  well  as 
artisanally mined deposits such as Falagountou artisanal mine. They occur as shear and quartz vein-
hosted deposits. Diamondiferous lamproite and lamprophyre plugs and dykes crop out NNW of Kaya 
in the Pissila batholith in the Barsalogo diamond field, with rare kimberlite pipes (WAXI, 2013). 
In  other  parts  of  the  WAC,  nickel,  chromium  and  platinum  group  elements  (PGEs)  occur  in 
ultramafic layered intrusions (Mickus, 2008). Schwartz and Melcher (2003) described  (1) Zn-Ag-Ba 
mineralisation  at  Perkoa  (Figure  1.1),  which  they  classified  as  a  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide 
(VHMS)  deposit,  and  (2)  Cu-Au  mineralisation  at  the  Gaoua  deposit,  which  they  interpreted  as 
porphyry  copper  in  style.  Such  mineralisation  styles  are  known  to  form  in  compressional  tectonic 
environments  and  support  the  idea  that  one  or  many  arcs  existed  (Baratoux  et  al.,  2011).  The  syn-
24

--- Page 25 ---
volcanic  VHMS  deposit  of  the  Tiebélé  Dome  in  the  south  of  Burkina  Faso  is  a  sphalerite  bearing, 
zinc-rich exhalative deposit (Ilboudo, 2010). 
2.5. The Goren volcano-sedimentary belt 
The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  was  deposited  approximately  2400-2300  Ma  and  is 
characterized  by  a  conformable  sequence  of  sedimentary  rocks,  interbedded  with  volcaniclastic  and 
pyroclastic deposits. Intercalated with this succession are mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks (Hein et 
al., 2004; Hein, 2010). The belt has subsequently been subjected to three deformation events as well as 
intruded  by  various  intrusive  bodies  and is  metamorphosed to  sub-greenschist to  middle  greenschist 
facies (Hein et al., 2004; Kříbek et al., 2008). 
Hein  et  al.  (2004)  established  the  stratigraphy  of  the  GB  which  comprises  a  succession  of 
siltstone  and  volcaniclastic  units  that  stratigraphically  young  into  a  mafic-intermediate  volcanic 
succession.  The  volcanic  rocks  are  made  up  of  an  intercalated  sequence  of  hyaloclastic  basalt, 
pillowed basalt, massive-variolitic basalt, andesite and dacite. The upper section of the stratigraphy is 
made up of a second volcano-sedimentary succession containing siltstone-shale beds, pebble-boulder 
conglomerates, greywacke-turbidite, felsic pyroclastic deposits, with thin  intercalations of basalt and 
andesite (Figure 2.1). 
Immediately west of the GB, volcanic, pyroclastic and sedimentary sequences are intruded by 
several tonalite and granodiorite plutons, and a megacrystic granite, as well as a number of greenschist 
facies meta-gabbro and meta-diorite intrusions. The Loudo and Pissila batholith crops out east of the 
GB. The Pissila  batholith is made up of biotite and hornblende granodiorites (Figure 2.1.)  (Simoko, 
2012;  WAXI,  2013)  and  is  cross-cut  by  tonalite  dykes  and  pegmatite  veins.  WNW-NW  trending 
dolerite dykes (215 ± 15 Ma; K-Ar whole-rock age; Hottin and Ouedraogo, 1992) cross-cut the GB 
(Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010). 
The  supracrustal  successions,  Pissila  batholith  and  various  mafic  intrusions  of  the  GB  were 
deformed during the Tangaean Event at 2170-2150 Ma (Hein, 2010). This was followed by a second 
deformation in which the supracrustal rocks were progressively subjected to NW-SE shortening during 
the Eburnean Orogeny (2145-2100 Ma; WAXI, 2013) as well as the emplacement of granodiorite and 
tonalite  plutons.  D1  and  D2  structures  were  crosscut  by  the  Wabo-Tampelse  Event  (undated)  in  a 
period of north-south shortening.

3. METHODOLOGY 
3.1. Field Methods 
A  desktop  study  of  the  field  area  was  completed  using  high  resolution  satellite  imagery  from 
Google Earth  ® prior to fieldwork. The images were studied in order to determine the most efficient 
way  to  undertake  mapping,  reconnaissance  work,  identifying  possible  sample  location  sites  and 
possible  traverse  lines.  Geological  mapping  focused  on  contacts,  structures,  facies  delineation  and 
volcanic  textures.  The  purpose  was  to  create  geological  and  facies  maps  (Figure  3.1  and  3.2)  with 
relevant cross sections (Figure 3.2) and graphic logs of field traverses (Figure B1 and B2, Appendix 
B). Wherever possible, lithologies where correlated from outcrop to outcrop. Outcrop was limited to 
the ridges.  
Field mapping was conducted with the essential tools. These included a compass clinometer to 
measure bedding and structural orientations,  and a GPS  that recorded the co-ordinates of the station 
points. The coordinates recorded on the GPS correspond to the UTM WGS 84 grid system (Zone 30P). 
Photographs were taken at every station point to provide evidence of observations and textures. 
Three field seasons were planned for between January 2012 and December 2013; however, only 
two  were  completed. The field  area  was  officially  declared  unsafe  in January  2013  because  of civil 
war in the neighbouring country of Mali, and access to the GB was restricted to foreigners. Due to the 
restricted access, a comparative study was undertaken using geochemical data by Ilboudo (2010) for 
the Tiebélé Dome in southern Burkina Faso, and Baratoux et al. (2011) for the Boromo, Houndé and 
Banfora belts, in order to investigate similarities and differences with the samples from the GB. 
The January 2012 field season was a reconnaissance season intended to gain insight into the size 
of  the  field  area  and  ideal  locations  for  sampling.  Limited  sampling  and  mapping  was  completed 
during  this  time.  The  March-April  2012  field  season  focused  on  detailed  geological  mapping  and 
sampling. 
The  spacing  between  traverses  varied,  depending  on  accessibility,  but  never  exceeded  3  km. 
Sampling was completed along each traverse in such a way as to ensure acquisition of a broad sample 
suite  with  specific  focus  on  weakly  deformed  zones  of  low  metamorphic  grade.  Permissions  were 
gained from the Bureau des Mines et de la Géologie du Burkina (BUMIGEB) to remove samples from 
Burkina Faso. The samples were transported to the University of the Witwatersrand Johannesburg for 
preparation and geochemical analyses, as well as petrographic study.  
A unique aspect of this study was the identification of volcanic facies in the field, in conjunction 
with an analysis of sedimentary rocks, both of which required considerable time and focus. Hein et al. 
(2004)  attempted to  classify  sequences  of  volcanic rock  on  volcanic  textures in the  GB; however,  a 
careful facies study, coupled with geochemistry and petrography provided insight into the volcanic

environment  at  the  time  of  deposition,  in  a  similar  way  that  sedimentary  rocks  have  yielded 
information about provenance and crustal evolution (e.g., McLennan et al., 1990, 1995).  
In  ancient  terranes,  such  as  the  WAC,  metamorphism,  deformation  and  erosion  limit  the 
preservation of volcanic textures (McPhie et al., 1993). However, in regions where metamorphism and 
deformation are less intense, textural preservation of samples may exist. 
The study of volcanic textures is an effective way of delineating volcanic facies. It enables the 
identification of both coherent and volcaniclastic facies (Cas and Wright, 1987; McPhie et al., 1993). 
The  term  volcaniclastic  in  this  context  includes  rocks  from  autoclastic,  pyroclastic  and  reworked 
volcano-sedimentary facies (Lajoie, 1984; Lajoie and Stix, 1992; McPhie et al., 1993). Hyaloclastites 
and flow breccias indicate autoclastic facies, which often occur  near coherent lavas (Lajoie and Stix, 
1992). Lavas can develop numerous textures, most because of cooling, such as those observed in the 
GB (e.g., hyaloclastites, jointing and volcanic glass).  
For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well 
preserved volcanic textures where the rocks are not strongly altered by hydrothermal processes and/or 
deformed  (McPhie  and  Allen,  2003).  An  example  of  this  is  the  devitrification  of  volcanic  glass,  as 
described  by  McPhie  and  Allen  (op  cit.,  2003);  crystal  boundaries  remain  intact  and  the  glass 
recrystallises as zeolites with a minor proportion of clay minerals.  
As a further example, metamorphosed Triassic basalt lavas in NW Croatia were interpreted as 
proximal  to intermediate  facies  by  Palinkaš  et  al. (2008)  based  on  volcanic textures  such  as  closely 
packed  pillows,  hyaloclastite,  pepperite  and  tortoise-shell  jointing.  These  textures  unequivocally 
evidenced subaqueous rift-related extrusion. 
It is without doubt that determining individual flow units or the original geometries of volcanic 
centres can be difficult, especially in old terranes. However, facies relationships are important as they 
provide  strong  evidence  of  environments  of  deposition.  They  are  useful  for  palaeo-environment 
reconstruction and establishing metallogenic potential. Thus the approach of Cas and Wright (1987), 
McPhie et al. (1993), Allen et al. (1996), and McPhie and Allen (2003) in analysing volcanic facies in 
detail to establish the environments of deposition, have been used in this research. 
3.2. Laboratory Methods 
X-ray  fluorescence  (XRF)  and  inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (ICPMS) 
analyses  were  completed  at  the  Earth  Lab  at  the  University  of  the  Witwatersrand,  Johannesburg. 
Twenty-nine (29) samples were analised. The XRF analyses were able to determine the composition 
of  each  sample  in  terms  of  major  and  minor  elements.  ICP-MS  analyses  were  completed  to 
specifically  measure  the  composition  of  minor  and  trace  elements.  Also,  by  using  two  different 
methods of analysis, potential discrepancies could be detected, e.g., similar Zr values (in ppm) from 
both analyses indicated consistent results and improved confidence.  
30

--- Page 32 ---
The  elemental  concentrations  were  obtained  by  comparison  to  13  known  standards.  The 
standards used included W2, GSP1, BHVO2, AGV2, G2, DTS1, PCC1, BCR2, NIM N, NIM P, NIM 
S, NIM D, NIM G (Govindaraju, 1994). A synthetic internal standard was run after every 5 analyses to 
monitor  and  compensate  for  instrumental  drift.  Agreement  to  recommended  values  was  better  than 
0·7% for all major elements and 5% for trace elements. 
All trace elements were analysed for pressed pellet. The preparation of the pressed pellet was 
achieved  by  mixing  approximately  6g  of  sample  with  three  drops  of  4%  commercially  purchased 
Mowiol (polyvinyl alcohol). This mixture was then pressed under 10 ton pressure into an aluminium 
cup using a 40 ton press. The pressed pellet was allowed to dry for 24 hours prior to analysis. 
PANalytical  software  Protrace®  was  used  to  process  the  raw  data.  The  standards  used  for  the 
calibration were the standards supplied by PANalytical. Protrace® drift standards were also run after 
every five analyses to compensate for instrument drift. Internal checks were performed by analysing 
known standards as unknowns and comparing them to reported concentrations. The known standards 
used were AGV2, BHVO2, GSP2, NIM D and NIM S (Govindaraju, 1994). 
3.2.2. Summary of ICP-MS analyses 
The  methodology  for  ICP  data  is  taken  from  the  Earth  Lab  at  the  University  of  the 
Witwatersrand,  Johannesburg.  The  samples  were  prepared  in  a  clean  laboratory,  which  had  special 
HEPA filters, along with other filters that remove all airborne contaminants. Samples were dissolved 
in a MARS microwave digester. 
50mg of sample was added to 6ml HF/HNO3 (3:2) and placed into the microwave digester at 
235 C  and  450  PSI,  for  40  minutes.  Samples  were  then  evaporated  on  a  hot  plate  at  70°C  until  all 
liquid was evaporated. 2ml of HNO3 was added, the beakers capped and placed on a hot plate at 60°C 
for  24  hours.  The  cap  was  removed  and  beakers  placed  on  a  hot  plate  at  70°C  until  all  liquid  was 
evaporated.  2ml  of  HNO3  was  then  added  and  left  to  evaporate.  Once  all  the  liquid  was  evaporated 
100µl of HNO3 was added and the sample was ready for the ELAN DRC-e ICP-MS, manufactured by 
PerkinElmer Sciex® 
The  samples  were  diluted  with  an  internal  standard  and  introduced  into  the  ICP-MS  through  a 
nebulizer where they were mixed with argon gas. They then passed through plasma which was at 75 
000°C.  The  elements  in  the  sample  were  ionized  by  the  plasma  and  became  positively  charged  by 
losing  their  loosely  bound  electrons.  These  positively  charged  ions  then  moved  into  the  quadrupole 
where  they  were  sorted  based  on  their  mass  to  charge  ratio,  after  which,  they  moved  to  a  detector 
which  received  the  ion  signal  that  was  proportional  to  the  concentration.  The  concentration  of  the 
sample  could  be  determined  through  calibration  with  certified  reference  material,  such  as  single  or 
multi-element  reference  standards.  Every  ICP-MS  determination  was  accompanied  by  control 
standards  BCR-1,  BHVO-1  and  BIR-1  and  for  all  elements  the  deviation  was  less  than  10%  from 
recommended values.

3.3. Petrography 
Polished thin sections and ore blocks were made for various pre-selected basalt and sedimentary 
samples.  This  included  thin  sections  of  28  basalt  samples,  9  dykes,  3  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous 
sedimentary  rocks,  1  pyroclastic  breccia  and  1  volcaniclastic  greywacke  sample.  The  ore  blocks 
included 2 basalt samples and 3 Mn-Fe-rich carbonaceous sedimentary samples. 
Petrographic analyses using transmitted light microscopy included: 
(1) Mineral identification. 
(2) Determination of modal abundances for each mineral. 
(3) Classification of the sample according to its mineralogy and alteration. 
(4)  Identification  of  textures,  including  primary  volcanic  and  sedimentary  textures  as  well  as 
secondary metamorphic and alteration textures. 
(5) Determination of the metamorphic grade using the mineralogy. 
Reflected light microscopy was used to identify oxide and sulphide minerals, their relationship 
to  silicate  minerals  and  how  they  were  hosted  (e.g.  disseminated,  vein-hosted).  Their  modal 
abundances, sizes and occurrences were described. 
Photomicrographs were taken of selected samples in order to emphasise certain textures. These 
images  were  captured  using  an  Olympus  DP26  camera  which  was  attached  to  an  Olympus  BX51 
petrographic  microscope.  Reflected  light  petrography  was  operated  by  an  Olympus  TH4-200  light 
box.  The  software  used  in  conjunction  with  the  Olympus  microscope  and  camera  was  Olympus 
Stream Essentials® version 1.7. Images were taken, after which the appropriate scale bar was burned 
onto the image. 
3.4. Maps and images 
Google  Earth®,  ArcGIS®  10,  Corel  Draw®  9  and  Adobe  Illustrator®  CS  2  were  used  to  create 
maps and images. Station points were imported from a Garmin Etrex-high sensitivity hand-held GPS 
device  to  Google  Earth®.  This  process  was  done  during  field  work  as  it  assisted  with  daily  field 
planning. A mosaic of the field area was created using Google Earth  ® satellite imagery. The mosaic 
was  imported  into  ArcGIS®,  then  geo-referenced  to  the  WGS84  UTM  co-ordinate  system  for  UTM 
Zone 30. Grid lines were added in ArcGIS®. The image was exported to CorelDraw® where polygons 
and  lines  were  overlain.  The  polygons  and  lines  represented  the  lithologies,  structure  and 
infrastructure  (Figure  3.1).  Adobe  Illustrator®  was  used  to  create  the  facies  map  (Figure  3.2),  facies 
model (Figure 7.1), and other schematic diagrams. 
Microsoft Publisher® 2010 was used to edit and format all geochemical graphs (refer to Figures 
6.1-6.18),  after  they  were  created  in  Sigma  Plot®  version  11.0  and  Microsoft  Excel®  2010.  All 
calculations  concerning  the  geochemical  data  were  completed  in  Excel®.  The  calculated  data  were 
33

--- Page 34 ---
then  copied  into  Sigma  Plot®  in  order  to  produce  scientific  graphs  that  Excel  cannot  do,  such  as 
ternary diagrams.

4. ROCK TYPES OF THE GOREN BELT 
4.1. Introduction 
The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are 
intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia. These rocks were intruded 
by  TTG  suite  plutons  including  the  Pissila  Batholith  and  the  Loudo  granodiorite  (Figure  2.1),  and 
pyroxenite,  dolerite  and  aplite  dykes.  The  basalt,  sedimentary  rocks  and  pyroclastic  breccias  are 
metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  (Kříbek  et  al.,  2008),  or  middle  greenschist  facies  (Hein  et  al., 
2004), with amphibolite facies adjacent to plutons and dykes. This research was focused in areas of the 
southern GB, where primary volcanic and sedimentary textures were only affected by sub-greenschist 
and lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism. 
4.2. Basaltic rocks 
The  basalts  of  the  southern  GB  exhibit  limited,  but  distinctive  volcanic  textures,  typical  of 
basaltic  rocks.  They  are  homogenous,  fine-grained,  and  brownish-green  in  colour  on  fresh  broken 
surfaces. Textures such as vesicles and amygdales, pillows and hyaloclastic brecciation are common. 
Less common features include tortoise-shell jointing, varioles and flow bands. Quartz-calcite-epidote 
veins commonly crosscut the basalts. 
Aphyric  to  aphanitic  textures  dominate  the  study  area.  They  are  typically  composed  of 
plagioclase-clinopyroxene microlites (approximately 2:1). The modal abundances ranged from 5-20 % 
plagioclase and 2-10 % clinopyroxene. 
Porphyritic  basalts  crop  out  south  of  the  Mané  Road  (Figure  4.1);  they  are  predominantly 
plagioclase-phyric with plagioclase crystals ranging from 0.1-1.5 mm, with rare occurrences in which 
plagioclase  crystals  measure  1.2  cm  in  length  (station  point  G12-02-099;  UTM  30P  696917; 
1441719). These porphyritic basalts are thus like the megacrystic tholeiitic basalt units described by 
Baratoux et al. (2011) from the Houndé and Boromo belts (Figure 1.1). 
Amygdales  are  present  in  most  outcrops  and  increase  in  concentration  near  the  margin  of 
individual  flow  units.  It  was  difficult  to  identify  multiple  flow  units  in  the  field  because  of  poor 
outcrop continuity, but some evidence suggested that more than one flow unit existed. Such evidence 
included the upper boundary of a flow unit continuing into the lower boundary of another, separated 
by  a  thin  chill  margin.  Pipe  amygdales  are  preserved  in  some  outcrops  (co-ordinates  UTM  30P 
0713145;  1431643  and  UTM  30P  713245;  1431519)  and  are  oriented  towards  the  upper  margin  of 
individual flow units.

Figure 4.1. Photograph of plagioclase crystals in porphyritic basalt (rare) demonstrating preferential weathering. Crystals 
measure 1.5 cm in length (Station point G12-02-098; UTM 30P 693240; 1443462). 
Hyaloclastic basalt breccias crop out throughout the southern GB as discrete units and as inter-
pillow  detritus  in  pillowed  basalt  units.  Commonly  pillow  basalt  grades  into  hyaloclastite  breccia 
units.  Breccia  fragments  are  surrounded  by  a  fine  crystalline  matrix  and/or  altered  volcanic  glass. 
Hyaloclastite breccia dominates in units of loosely packed pillows (Figure 4.2a). 
Pillow lavas are abundant throughout the study area, particularly in the western arm of the GB 
between the Mané road and the Kaya-Ouagadougou national highway. The pillows range in size from 
10 to 100 cm across. 
36

--- Page 37 ---
Several  outcrops  present  well  defined  re-entrants,  with  vesicle  accumulation  on  the  pillow 
margins,  and  chilled  margins  (Figure  4.2b,  c).  Stratigraphic  facing  was  established  from  the 
orientation  of  the  pillow  re-entrant,  the  direction  of  pillow  inflation,  and  the  direction  in  which 
amygdales  increased  in  concentration.  These  textures  indicated  that  the  overall  stratigraphic  facing 
direction  was  north-northeast  with  only  one  facing  west-southwest  locality  (Station  point  G12-02-
131). The pillow forms decrease in stratigraphically upward, which is a texture described by McPhie 
et  al.  (1993),  who  observed  that  pillows  tended  to  decrease  in  size  as  they  stratigraphically  young 
during a period of continuous volcanism. In the study area a decrease in pillow size was observed over 
a distance of 5 m. 
Figure  4.2.  (a)  Photograph  of pillows  in a  hyaloclastic breccia  (Pi  =  Pillow;  Hy  =  Hyaloclastite)  where  the  hyaloclastic 
breccia is observed in the inter-pillow domains (Sample G12-02-110, UTM 30P 694964; 1440271). Pillows are 20-30 cm 
with chill margins less than 1 cm thick. (b) Photograph of amygdaloidal pillowed basalt with amygdales concentrated on the 
pillow  margins  compared  to  the  centre  of  the  pillow  (Sample  G12-008,  UTM  30P  694317;  1443450).  The  amygdales  are 
elongate toward the margin of the pillow and measure 2 cm in length. (c) Photograph of hyaloclastic pillow basalt displaying 
an ~10 cm pillow with well-defined amygdale accumulation on the margin of the pillow, with hyaloclastic breccia enclosing 
it. 
37

--- Page 38 ---
In  some  locations,  pillows  are  flattened  (Figure  4.3a).  Furthermore,  a  range  of  syn-volcanic 
deformation  textures  are  present  and  these  relate  to  cooling  of  the  basalt  units  after  extrusion.  The 
deformation textures included:- 
(1) Pseudo-pillows representing a texture derived from cooling of massive basalt (c.f., McPhie et al., 
op cit.). 
(2) Syn-volcanic tensile fractures (Figure 4.3b). These fractures are approximately 5 cm in length and 
are caused by differential cooling of the basalt pile. 
(3) Tortoise-shell joints, which are interpreted to be the result of the interaction of lava with cold fluid, 
water or air during extrusion (Figure 4.3c). 
Flow  banding  occurs.  The  bands  measure  ~1  cm  in  thickness  (Figure  4.4a).  The  bands  are 
mineralogically controlled, as observed by the colour of each band. Leucocratic bands are plagioclase-
rich whereas melanocratic bands are epidote-chlorite rich.  
The basalt units south-east of the Mané Road and adjacent to the Sirgui artisanal mine (Figure 
2.1)  are  texturally  well-preserved.  They  not  only  show  well-defined  pillow  basalts,  but  a  variety  of 
features  related  to  flow  and  cooling.  This  includes  hyaloclastite  (Figure  4.4b),  jointing  and  flow 
banding.  Differential  weathering  exposed  large  plagioclase  crystals  (0.5-1.2  cm)  which  stand  out 
outcrop (Figure 4.1). 
Variolitic  basalts  crop  out  between  Mané  and  the  Silimidougou  megacrystic  granite  and  in 
isolated outcrops in the Tangapella region, in the central northern GB (Figure 2.1). The varioles are 
approximately 0.5-2.0 cm in diameter and composed of plagioclase feldspar crystals.

4.3. Metasedimentary rocks 
Siltstone,  volcaniclastite,  greywacke  and  exhalative  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary 
rocks  constitute  an  interbedded  sequence  of  sedimentary  rocks  in  the  GB.  Individual  lithologies  are 
between 2 and 50 metres in stratigraphic thickness. 
4.3.1. Siltstone 
The  laterally  extensive  siltstone  units  in  the  GB  are  noticeably  deformed  and  tightly  folded. 
Structurally,  they  have  well-defined  cleavage  planes,  micro-faults  and  outcrop-sized  isoclinal  folds. 
They are made up of alternating Fe-rich and Fe-poor beds of fine-grained, silt-sized  detritus (Figure 
4.5a). Beds range in size from 5 mm to 6 cm. Planar laminations are well preserved. 
4.3.2. Volcaniclastite 
A poorly sorted, medium to coarse-grained volcaniclastite unit crops out along both arms of the 
southern GB, particularly, along the western arm. The volcaniclastite unit consists of fine to medium-
grained plagioclase, chlorite and fine  lithic fragments. It is commonly interbedded with the siltstone 
and basalt but the unit is poorly exposed across the study area and is poorly preserved. 
4.3.3. Greywacke 
The greywacke succession is volcaniclastic. In outcrop, primary bedding features such as planar 
cross bedding, flame structures, mud drapes, chert interbeds, conglomerate beds (~20 cm thick) and 
scour marks are present. The greywacke is typically coarse-grained and poorly sorted and is composed 
of quartz, plagioclase, hornblende, clinopyroxene and chert clasts. The succession is pyritised in part, 
with  visible  pyrite  in  some  beds  (e.g.  Station  point  G12-02-118;  Figure  3.1).  The  succession  trends 
northwest and dips northeast with a mean strike and dip of 145° 54° NE. 
Interbedded conglomerate horizons also present as basal units of a fining-upwards succession. 
They  are  characterized  as  rounded  to  sub-rounded  pebble  quartzite  (0.5-4.0  cm),  with  minor  chert 
pebbles (Figure 4.5b) that grade into gritstone, sandstone and siltstone, representing an overall fining 
upwards sequence (Figure 4.5c, d). Mud balls are also seen throughout the greywacke succession. 
4.3.4. Pyroclastic breccia 
A northwest-trending pyroclastic breccia deposit crops out along the western branch of the GB (Figure 
3.1) as an interbed within the greywacke succession, and over a strike length of approximately 5 km. 
The unit has been dated at 2192 ± 9 Ma (U-Pb  zircon, WAXI, 2013) and is reported by Hein et al. 
(2004)  as  the  upper  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  for  the  GB.  The  pyroclastic  breccia  is  generally 
polylithic,  ungraded  and  poorly-sorted.  It  is  made  up  of  euhedral  to  subhedral  crystals  of  quartz, 
plagioclase,  hornblende  and  minor  clinopyroxene.  Crystals  of  ilmenite  and  magnetite  are  visible  in 
hand specimen. Sub-rounded blocks and bombs (5-20 cm in diameter) are accidental lithic fragments

711294; 1431532). Bed thicknesses range from 1 mm to 5 cm. Micro-faults crosscut the siltstone. The siltstone exhibits well 
developed  cleavage  planes,  particularly  prominent  in  the  Fe-rich  layers.  (b)  Photograph  of  a  fining  upward  greywacke

layer  of  Unit  1.  The  depositional  environment  is  interpreted  as  a  marginal  marine-offshore  setting.  (c)  Photograph  of  a

sorted, massive volcanogenic greywacke (Sample G12-02-093, UTM 30P 709616; 1429270). The angular fragments measure 
up to 3 cm in size.

interpreted to have been incorporated in the breccia during volcanic eruption(s). Ash and lapilli-sized 
detritus in the breccia varies in size from 1 mm to 5 cm (Figure 4.6 a, b). 
4.3.5. Mn-Fe-rich carbonaceous sedimentary rocks 
Northwest-trending Mn-Fe-rich, carbonaceous sedimentary rocks crop out throughout the study 
area, parallel to the overall lithological trend of the GB. These rocks are characterized by fine-grained, 
carbon-bearing  massive  units,  or  finely  laminated  units  with  a  variable  amount  of  carbon.  They 
commonly  exhibit  soft-sediment  deformation  textures  such  as  randomly  orientated,  metre-sized 
isoclinal slump folds. They are interpreted to have formed during gravity sliding prior to lithification. 
The  Mn-Fe-rich  sedimentary  units  are  often  interbedded  with  thin  (1.0  cm  thick)  chert  beds. 
They  are  dominated  by  ankerite,  hematite,  magnetite,  and  braunite.  Centimetre-scale  botryoidal 
textures are present and are common supergene alteration features of Fe and Mn minerals in the WAC. 
Light-coloured  dolomite  beds  (5  to  30  cm  thick)  occur  as  interbeds  within  the  Mn-Fe-carbon-rich 
beds.  The  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  crosscut  by  bedding-parallel  and 
stockwork-brecciated quartz-carbonate veins.

sub-angular crystals of ilmenite, magnetite, plagioclase, quartz and hornblende, ranging in size from 2 mm to 7 cm (Sample 
G12-02-126, UTM 30P 709365; 1424791). 
4.4. Intrusions 
4.4.1. Mafic dykes and sills 
Undated pyroxenite and dolerite dykes and sills (20 m to several hundreds of metres) crosscut 
the supracrustal rocks of the field area. The dykes and sills trend northwest, parallel to sub-parallel to 
43

--- Page 44 ---
bedding, and crop out throughout the southern GB. They are medium to coarse crystalline (0.4-2 cm) 
and composed of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, hornblende and minor orthopyroxene. 
Variations in composition and modal abundances  are  measured.  Dolerite dykes  and sills  were 
characterized  by  average  modal  abundances  of  45  %  plagioclase  and  40-45  %  clinopyroxene.  The 
remaining mineralogy is identified as Fe-oxides. Hornblende usually makes up approximately 10 % of 
the modal abundance when present. In Sample G12-02-017, the proportion of hornblende attained 30 
%; hornblende-rich dolerite has a proportionally lower percentage of clinopyroxene. 
The  pyroxenite  dykes  and  sills  were  classified  according  to  their  higher  proportion  of 
clinopyroxene  relative  to  plagioclase.  This  is  typically  70-80  %  clinopyroxene  with  less  than  15  % 
plagioclase. 
4.4.2. Aplite dykes 
Northeast-trending aplite dykes occur in the GB. They are medium-grained (3 mm crystal size) 
with visible quartz, plagioclase and K-feldspar.  
4.4.3. Loudo granodiorite 
The Loudo granodiorite crops out south of Kaya in the study area. It was described by Hein et 
al.  (2004)  as  hornblende  granodiorite  with  a  plagioclase,  quartz,  hornblende,  K-feldspar,  biotite 
groundmass. It hosts mafic xenoliths that vary in size and shape. The southern contact crops out south 
of the town of Loudo where it intrudes basalt. A discrete contact aureole is defined.

5.  PETROGRAPHIC  OBSERVATIONS  OF  SELECTED  SAMPLES  FROM  THE 
GOREN BELT 
5.1. Basaltic rocks 
A  petrographic  study  of  28  basalt  samples  was  completed  at  the  University  of  the 
Witwatersrand Johannesburg.  The  petrography  shows  that  the  basaltic  rocks  are  dominantly  aphyric 
and  compositionally  similar.  The  primary  mineralogy  of  the  samples  is  composed  of  clinopyroxene 
and  plagioclase.  Plagioclase  and  clinopyroxene  made  up  between  5  and  15  %  of  the  samples  as 
variably altered microlites (Figure 5.1a). Disseminated Fe-oxides, ilmenite and magnetite, comprise a 
large modal abundance, approximately 20-40% of the samples (Figure 5.1b). They occur interstitially 
as subhedral and euhedral crystals and range in size between 0.2-2.0 mm. Disseminated, fine-grained 
(< 0.1 mm), subhedral to euhedral sulphides such as pyrite and chalcopyrite constitute an approximate 
0.5-2.0% of the modal abundance. For the porphyritic plagioclase-phyric basalts described in Section 
4.2, the phenocryst abundance is approximately 5 % (Figure 5.1c). 
Plagioclase crystals in the basalt samples are generally < 0.4 mm in size except for porphyritic 
samples in which plagioclase phenocrysts  are 0.5-1.5 mm. The crystal shapes vary from anhedral to 
subhedral,  and  euhedral  forms  are  rare.  Euhedral  plagioclase  crystals  are  typically  tabular, 
occasionally  elongate  (lath-like),  and  display  clearly  defined  albite  twinning.  Intensely  altered 
plagioclase is identifiable from relict albite twinning. 
Clinopyroxene crystals range from < 0.1 mm to 0.4 mm in size. They are generally anhedral to 
subhedral  in  shape.  Twinning,  supposedly  rare  (c.f.,  Nesse,  2000)  is  present  in  some  of  the 
clinopyroxene crystals.  
The  28  basalt  samples  present  a  range  of  volcanic  textures  as  described  in  Chapter  4.  The  textures 
include amygdales, basaltic hyaloclastic breccia, varioles, as well as porphyritic and aphyric texture. 
Petrographically,  circular  to  irregular  shaped  amygdales  are  commonly  filled  with  quartz,  calcite, 
epidote and zeolite group minerals (Figure 5.1d). Crystal growth within amygdales commonly radiates 
inward from the margins. The amygdales vary in diameter from 0.5 mm to greater than 5 mm. In some 
instances, amygdales are composed of a micron-scale fill of chlorite (Figure 5.2).  
Petrographically, the hyaloclastic breccia samples are composed of finely crystalline, aphanitic 
basalt fragments. They  contain  a  matrix  of  fine-grained  polycrystalline  quartz,  calcite,  zeolite  group 
minerals,  needle-shaped  actinolite,  epidote  and  chloritised  volcanic  glass  (Figure  5.2  b,  c).  Quartz-
carbonate  veins  crosscut  the  hyaloclastite  breccia,  suggesting  vein  infill  occurred  after  cooling  and 
fragmentation took place. Epidote veins also crosscut hyaloclastic breccia fragments.

Figure 5.1. (a) Photomicrograph of basalt exhibiting subhedral plagioclase microlites, a largely  chlorite-epidote replaced 
groundmass, and an amygdale containing chlorite and subhedral zeolite crystals (Sample G12-009; plane polarized light). 
(b) Photomicrograph of a microlitic basalt containing < 1.5 mm euhedral plagioclase microlites, anhedral ilmenite (opaque), 
interstitial quartz and a high proportion of chlorite (Sample G12-009; UTM 30P 693302; 1444147; plane polarized light). 
(c)  Photomicrograph  of  a  porphyritic  basalt  with  0.5-1.0  mm  partly  altered  plagioclase  crystals.  The  groundmass  is 
composed of chlorite and epidote, which is interpreted to be the result of plagioclase and clinopyroxene microlite alteration 
(G12-018;  UTM  30P  695652;  1466804).  (d)  Photomicrograph  of  an  amygdale  in  amygdaloidal  basalt.  The  amygdale  is 
interpreted to form due to passive degassing of the basaltic liquid and these are filled with various minerals at a later stage. 
In this case, the infill is with epidote and zeolite group minerals. The amygdale exhibits a sub-rounded shape in which the 
zeolite  crystals  radiate  inward  from  the  amygdale boundary  toward  a  fine-grained aggregate  of  epidote  (Sample  G12-02-
057; UTM 30P 699990; 1435556; cross polarized light). 
46

--- Page 47 ---
Microscopically, variolitic basalts are composed of altered, skeletal plagioclase. The plagioclase 
crystals radiate outward from a central nucleus. Varioles measure 0.5 mm in diameter. 
Figure 5.2. (a) Photomicrograph of a medium grained, amygdaloidal basalt that displays a partly chloritised amygdale filled 
with devitrified glass. The amygdale is rimmed by zeolites. Smaller amygdales in the image are also filled with chlorite and 
zeolite  (G12-02-096;  plane  polarized  light.  (b,  c)  Photomicrographs  of  hyaloclastic  basalt  (1:1  scale)  that  is  altered  to 
chlorite-actinolite.  The  hyaloclastite  is  brecciated  in  a  jigsaw  of  basalt  fragments.  The  breccia  matrix  is  composed  of 
chloritised  volcanic  glass.  Late  stage  epidote  veins  crosscut  the  hyaloclastic  breccia  (G12-02-099;  UTM  30P  696917; 
1441719 and G12-02-057; UTM 30P 699990; 1435556; plane polarized light). 
With regard to alteration mineralogies, the 28 basalt samples were, in general altered to a fine-
grained  assemblage  of  epidote,  chlorite,  and  actinolite  with  accessory  calcite,  zeolite  and  quartz 
(Figure 5.3a, b). Epidote and chlorite replaced pyroxene as reaction rims, crystal core replacement and 
overgrowths.  In  turn,  hematite-goethite  overprints  epidote  and  chlorite.  Plagioclase  is  partially  to 
completely  replaced  by  chlorite  leaving  ghost  relict  twins  and  taking  the  form  of  the  plagioclase 
crystal. Some basalt samples present a non-pervasive mineral foliation defined by chlorite, actinolite 
and  quartz.  Calcite  and  quartz  occur  primarily  in  veins,  indicating  that  quartz-carbonate  alteration 
postdates metamorphism (Figure 5.3c.). Interstitial, polycrystalline quartz was also abundant as part of 
the metamorphic alteration assemblage. 
Pyrite and chalcopyrite occur in veins or fractures (Figure 5.3d) and on the margin of primary, 
disseminated  sulphide  and  oxide  crystals.  The  presence  of  vein-hosted  sulphides  and  sulphide  rims 
around  disseminated  oxide-sulphides  is  interpreted  to  be  primary  and/or  secondary  sulphide 
precipitation.

Figure  5.3.  (a)  Photomicrograph  of  a  medium-grained  basalt  composed  of  metamorphic  mineralogy.  The  image  exhibits 
well-formed, < 3.5 mm epidote crystals surrounded by a fine-grained epidote and chlorite (Sample G12-02-096; UTM 30P 
694686;  1443104;  cross  polarized  light).  (b)  Photomicrograph  of  a  basalt  that  displays  plagioclase  with  an  overprint  of 
epidote  and  chlorite.  Plagioclase  is  partly  replaced  by  chlorite,  but  retains  it  lath-like  shape,  is  randomly  oriented  and 
exhibits albite twinning (Sample G12-02-095; UTM 30P 695421; 1443258). (c) Photomicrograph of basalt that is crosscut 
by a quartz-calcite vein. The basalt is altered to chlorite-epidote but retains minor primary plagioclase microlites. The vein 
crosscuts both primary and secondary mineralogies indicating it formed syn- or post-alteration. (Sample G12-02-095; cross 
polarized light). (d) Photomicrograph of pyrite and chalcopyrite in a vein that crosscuts basalt (Sample G12-02-096; UTM 
30P 694686;  1443104;  Reflected-light).  The  texture  indicates  that  sulphide  mineralization  is  synchronous  to, or  postdates 
emplacement of the basalt sequence. 
5.2. Metasedimentary rocks 
5.2.1. Volcanogenic greywacke 
Polylithic, poorly sorted greywacke exhibits a range of grain sizes from 0.1-4.0 mm. It contains 
angular  to  sub-rounded  clasts  and  fragments.  The  dominant  mineralogy  includes  angular  to  sub-
angular clinopyroxene, quartz and plagioclase grains as well as rounded to sub-rounded chert clasts. 
The  clinopyroxene  grains  occasionally  display  twinning,  which  has  also  been  reported  for 
clinopyroxene  grains  in  greywacke  sequences  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  volcano-sedimentary  belt 
(Peters, 2011). 
Plagioclase  grains  in  the  greywackes  of  the  study  area  vary  in  size  between  2  and  4  mm,  are 
elongate and display albite twinning. Relic twins were noted in the larger grains as the plagioclase has 
48

--- Page 49 ---
undergone  deuteric  alteration.  The  matrix  makes  up  approximately  25  %  of  the  rock.  The  matrix  is 
composed of fine to medium-grained polycrystalline quartz and chert (Figure 5.4a). The presence of 
non-detrital chlorite and epidote in the matrix, associated with epidote replacement of clinopyroxene 
grains,  indicates  greenschist  facies  metamorphism,  post-deposition  (Nesse,  2000).  Sericite  and 
polycrystalline  quartz  occur  as  an  alteration  texture.  Approximately  15%  of  the  quartz  observed  is 
secondary, as shown by quartz veins and interstitial grains with poorly to non-visible grain boundaries. 
The  secondary  quartz  constitutes  a  high  proportion  of  the  quartz  observed  in  the  matrix. 
Approximately  5%  of  the  modal  abundance  of  the  greywacke  is  composed  of  fine-grained, 
disseminated pyrite, chalcopyrite, ilmenite and magnetite. 
5.2.2. Pyroclastic breccia 
Petrographic study of the pyroclastic breccia confirm that it is a polylithic, coarse-grained unit 
dominated  by  a  mineral  assemblage  of  angular  to  sub-angular  quartz,  euhedral  plagioclase, 
hornblende,  anhedral  clinopyroxene,  ilmenite  and  magnetite,  with  disseminated  iron  sulphides. 
Rounded to sub-rounded chert clasts are also present in the breccia. 
The  quartz  clasts  range  in  size  from  0.5-4.0  mm  (Figure  5.4b,  c).  Chert  clasts  are  wholly 
composed of microcrystalline aggregates of quartz. Plagioclase exhibits a range of sizes from 2-4 mm 
and is deuterically altered, but exhibits relict albite twinning. Crystals of volcanic hornblende (2-4 mm 
in length) are brown, euhedral and zoned (Figure 5.4d), and present well-developed cleavage planes. 
The hornblende constitutes approximately 15 % of the modal abundance of the breccia.  
The matrix of the pyroclastic breccia is composed of sericite, chlorite, epidote and carbonate and fine-
grained  quartz  and  plagioclase  crystals.  Approximately  25-30  %  of  the  modal  abundance  of  the 
pyroclastic  breccia  is  composed  of  matrix.  Polycrystalline  aggregates  of  secondary  quartz  are  also 
observed  within  the  matrix  and  make  up  approximately  35%  of  the  fine-grained,  interstitial 
mineralogy.  
5.2.3. Mn-Fe-rich carbonaceous sedimentary rocks 
Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  composed  of  braunite,  magnetite,  ilmenite 
hematite,  graphite,  disseminated  pyrite  and  chalcopyrite,  and  0.01-0.2  mm  interstitial  quartz  grains. 
Braunite occurs as breccia, tablets and colloform textures (Figure 5.5a). Braunite is also vein-hosted. 
Hematite  is  observed  as  anastomosing  veins  that  crosscut  the  host  rock  (Figure  5.5b)  and 
ilmenite  and  magnetite  occur  as  veins  and  disseminations  (Figure  5.5c).  In  reflected  light, 
disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite makes up approximately 2 % of the modal abundance of the Mn-
Fe-rich  carbonaceous  samples.  Micron-scale  grains  of  gold  are  disseminated  through  the  rocks. 
Quartz-carbonate  veins  and  stockwork  breccias  crosscut  these  mineralogies  (Figure  5.5d).  A  second 
phase of quartz veining crosscuts the pre-existing textures.

Figure 5.4. (a) Photomicrographs of a coarse-grained, poorly sorted, chlorite-rich volcanogenic greywacke. The sample is 
composed  of  quartz,  plagioclase  (>  2mm),  lithic  chert  clasts,  and  biotite  (Sample  G12-007;  696828;  1443986).  (b,  c) 
Photomicrographs of pyroclastic breccia containing euhedral, coarse-grained (> 1mm) plagioclase, chert, quartz and fine-
grained (< 0.5mm) epidote replacing clinopyroxene and hornblende. The matrix is interpreted to be composed of ash-lapilli 
sized fragments that are altered to epidote and chlorite (Sample G12-02-126; UTM 30P 709365; 1424791, cross polarized 
light). (d) Photomicrograph of pyroclastic breccia that is composed of euhedral, coarse-grained (> 1 mm), zoned, volcanic 
hornblende, with well-defined cleavage, and l> 2 mm sub-rounded chert clasts and sub-angular quartz grains (Sample G12-
02-126; UTM 30P 709365; 1424791, plane polarized light). 
5.3. Intrusions 
5.3.1. Mafic dykes and sills 
Seven samples of mafic dykes or sills were examined petrographically in this study. Based on 
their mineralogy they were grouped into:- 
(1)  Dolerite  -  composition  was  determined  for  four  samples;  on  average,  the  dolerite  intrusions  are 
composed  of  45%  clinopyroxene  and  45%  plagioclase.  Accessory  minerals  include  biotite  and 
muscovite, comprising approximately 5-10% of the modal abundance. Sample G12-02-036, which is 
50

--- Page 51 ---
composed  of  plagioclase-clinopyroxene-hornblende-orthopyroxene, 
is  composed  of  15-20% 
hornblende.  It  can  (effectively)  be  classified  as  a  hornblende-rich  dyke  similar  in  composition  to 
dolerite. The sample exhibits intrusive textures such as K-feldspar exsolution lamellae within euhedral 
plagioclase  crystals  and  exsolution  between  clinopyroxene  and  orthopyroxene  crystals,  as  shown  by 
orthopyroxene lamellae. 
(2) Feldspathic pyroxenite - composition was determined for two samples. The samples have  higher 
proportions of clinopyroxene (approximately 60-65 %) and less plagioclase than the dolerite samples. 
Accessory  minerals  include  biotite  and  muscovite  comprising  approximately  5-10%  of  the  modal 
abundance. 
Figure 5.5. (a) Photomicrograph of tabular, colloform and brecciated braunite from a  Mn-Fe-rich unit (Sample G12-004; 
UTM  30P  702744;  1446079,  reflected  light).  The  three  textures  of  braunite  suggest  different  growth  phases.  Late  stage 
fractures cross-cut brecciated braunite and terminate against the tabular braunite indicating that tabular braunite developed 
after  the  colloform  texture  braunite.  (b)  Photomicrograph  of  a  Mn-Fe-rich,  carbonaceous  unit  which  is  crosscut  by 
anastomosing hematite veins (Sample G12-02-080; UTM 30P 703512; 1444037, reflected light). (c) Photomicrograph of a 
Mn-Fe-rich unit that are crosscut by ilmenite-bearing veins. The ilmenite, in this case, is interpreted as a secondary phase 
because it is vein-hosted in the rocks (Sample G12-02-35; UTM 30P 707346; 1425026, reflected light). (d) Photomicrograph 
of a Mn-Fe carbonaceous unit that is crosscut by stockwork quartz ± ankerite veins. The rock is altered to hematite, ilmenite, 
magnetite and secondary quartz (sample G12-017; UTM 30P 677996; 1466647, plane polarized light). 
51

--- Page 52 ---
(3)  Pyroxenite  -  composition  is  determined  for  one  sample.  The  dyke\sill  is  dominated  by 
clinopyroxene  (greater  than  75%)  with  minor  orthopyroxene.  The  plagioclase  modal  proportion  for 
this sample is between 15 and 20%. 
Clinopyroxene  is  the  dominant  mineral  in  the  mafic  suite;  it  exhibits  twinning  and  low  to 
moderate alteration. The clinopyroxene crystals are subhedral in shape and range in size from 1.0-3.5 
mm. 
Sulphides  are  present  in  all  samples.  Pyrite,  chalcopyrite  and  bornite  are  disseminated 
throughout  the  rocks  and  typically  constitute  an  approximately  1  %  modal  abundance.  However, 
chalcostibite  occurs  with  chalcopyrite  intergrowths  within  Sample  G12-02-122  (Figure  5.6a).  The 
chalcostibite has a modal abundance of 10 % and measures between 2 and 5 mm in size. The sulphide 
is characterized by triangular pits, a moderate reflection and a soft texture as shown by scratch and pit 
marks on the polished surface. 
5.3.2. Aplite dykes 
Aplite  dykes  in  the  study  area  contain  plagioclase,  quartz,  orthoclase  and  microcline,  with 
accessory biotite and muscovite (Figure. 5.6b). Carlsbad twinning is present in the orthoclase crystals, 
but is not present in all grains. Cu-bearing sulphides occur on the margins and within biotite crystals, 
indicating a preferential relationship between the sulphides and biotite. They make up approximately 
0.5-1.0 % of the modal abundance of the rocks. 
Textures  included  (1)  exsolution  between  orthoclase  and  plagioclase,  evident  as  globular 
lamellae, (2) myrmekitic texture which is represented as intergrowths between quartz and plagioclase, 
and  (3)  poikilitic  texture,  is  observed  as  fine-grained  muscovite  and  biotite  enclosed  within  larger 
quartz and orthoclase crystals.

subordinate  muscovite.  The  mineralogy  is  unaltered  (Sample  G12-02-114;  UTM  30P  711540;  1432977,  cross  polarized 
light). (b) Photomicrograph of a chalcostibite in dolerite. Chalcostibite forms large, disseminated crystals. The chalcostibite 
crystals are soft (shown by scratches), contain triangular pits, and have a moderate reflectivity (Sample G12-02-122; UTM 
30P 709363; 1425384, reflected light).

6. GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOREN BELT 
6.1. Geochemistry of the volcanic rocks 
Whole-rock analyses were completed on 20 volcanic and 6 sedimentary samples using XRF and 
ICP-MS. Both major elements and trace elements were measured using XRF spectrometry. The data 
were calculated in wt% for the major elements and parts per million (ppm) for the trace elements. The 
ICP-MS  analyses  are  reported  in  ppm.  A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to 
classify the samples in order to characterize the tectonic setting for volcanic rocks of the GB. 
Geochemical data for volcanic rocks from the Boromo and Houndé belts, Oudalan-Gorouol belt 
and Tiebélé belt  were used in a comparative study of volcanic units across several different belts in 
Burkina Faso. Data from Baratoux et al. (2011) include 7 tholeiitic basalt samples and 6 calc-alkaline 
volcanic samples that were reported for the Boromo and Houndé belts in western Burkina Faso. Data 
from Ilboudo (2010) were reported for the Tiebélé region in the south of the country. Tshibubudze and 
Hein  (2013)  reported  data  for  two  meta-volcanic  samples  (major-elements  only)  from  the  Oudalan-
Gorouol belt (OGB) in the northeast of Burkina Faso. 
The  volcanic  rocks  of  the  GB  have  undergone  variable  metamorphism,  varying  from  sub-
greenschist to amphibolite facies (Kříbek et al., 2008). The rocks are also variably silicified. Increased 
silica was taken into account by determining its abundance through field and petrographic observation 
when interpreting the geochemistry by measuring relationships between chemical variables, using the 
correlation coefficient (r). 
The  alteration of the rocks  indicates that  HFSE  such as  Ta,  Nb,  Ce,  P,  Zr,  Hf, Sm,  Ti,  Y  are 
immobile  during  greenschist  facies  metamorphism  (Pearce,  1983;  Saunders  and  Tarney,  1984; 
Rollinson, 1993). In  general,  Th is  considered to be less mobile, but not to the extent of the HFSE. 
Large ion lithophile elements (LILE) such as Rb, Sr and Ba are normally significantly mobile during 
alteration  and  greenschist  facies  conditions.  Due  to  the  immobility  of  HFSE,  it  was  not  likely  that 
correlations  resulted  from  secondary  alteration  processes,  but  rather  reflected  the  true  nature  of  the 
primary chemistry of the rocks. 
6.1.1. Major element geochemistry 
The XRF data (Appendix C) for selected samples of volcanic rocks from the GB  yield a SiO2 
range  between  48.92  and 59.86  wt %.  MgO  values varied  from  3.31  to  8.16 wt  %,  while the Mg  # 
ranges from 31.64-57.52 and has an average value of 45.77. Al2O3 ranges from 10.65 to 15.59 wt %. 
The sum of Na2O and K2O generally equals less than 4 wt%. The FeO content ranges from 10.24 to 
14.57 wt% and P2O5 values  are between 0.07 and 0.21. Using  these data, a number of classification 
diagrams (Figures 6.3a - e) were used to establish the type of volcanic rocks that make up the southern 
GB.

Major elements have likely been affected by alteration, thus making any interpretations based 
on  them  less  reliable.  However,  analyses  can  still  be  done,  albeit  with  caution.  Mineral  abundances 
from  CIPW  norms  were  plotted  on  a  Streckeisen  classification  diagram  (Streckeisen,  1976)  for 
volcanic rocks  (Figure 6.1a). The data resolves a trend from the basalt field towards the dacite field 
with  increasing  silica  content  and  a  minor  increase  in  K,  which  is  interpreted  to  be  the  result  of 
potassium mobility during alteration, such as silicification. The overall data trend observed is thus not 
surprising, particularly because the rocks  have been silicified. Further to this,  it is important to note 
that  the  Streckeisen  classification  diagram,  when  plotted  using  the  CIPW  norm,  is  not  able  to 
distinguish between primary and secondary minerals, in this case quartz. Confirmation of secondary 
silica was therefore determined by petrographic analyses of the samples (Chapter 5). 
A classification diagram using the  immobile element ratios of Nb/Y plotted against Zr/TiO2 x 
0.0001 after Winchester and Floyd (1976) was plotted for the GB volcanic rocks  (Figure 6.1b). The 
samples plot well within the basalt field with the  exception of  Sample G12-02-126, which straddles 
the boundary between the basalt and basaltic andesite fields. 
A total alkalis versus silica (TAS) diagram (after Le Maitre et al., 1989) plots samples within 
the basalt, basaltic andesite and andesite fields (Figure 6.1c). The TAS diagram indicates that the rocks 
are  sub-alkaline  (tholeiitic)  in  composition.  A  comparison  of  the  GB  samples  with  the  Boromo-
Houndé  volcanics  reported  by  Baratoux  et  al.  (2011),  Tiebélé  volcanics  reported  by  Ilboudo  (2010) 
and 2 samples from the OGB reported by Tshibubudze  and Hein (2013) indicates that most samples 
plot within the basalt and basaltic andesite field. The samples range from 45.5 to 55.9 SiO2 (wt%) with 
the lowest  SiO2  concentration  sampled  from  the  Tiebélé region  and  the  highest from  the  GB.  Some 
samples  from  Tiebélé  and Boromo-Houndé  belts  show  higher  Na2O+K2O  (wt%)  when  compared  to 
the GB volcanics. The OGB samples show a relatively large difference in SiO2. Sample BF_1366, in 
particular reported little Na2O+K2O (~ 0.2 wt %). The Boromo-Houndé volcanics plot on a trend from 
basalt to andesite as the SiO2 and Na2O+K2O increased. The Tiebélé samples (HTPILL and HTBA), 
which had been classified as basaltic rocks by Ilboudo (2010),show high Na2O+K2O values (up to ~6 
and  10  wt%)  and  plot  as  tephrite/basanite  and  trachyandesite,  respectively.  Sample  HTGOGO  from 
the Tiebélé region, plots as an alkaline volcanic rock in the basalt field. The highest K2O+Na2O value 
from  the  Tiebélé  samples  is  9.86  wt%.  The  GB  samples  show  a  maximum  K2O+Na2O  value  of  4.7 
wt%. 
A  further  sub-division  of sub-alkalic  rocks  is  shown using  SiO2  versus K2O  in wt% in  Figure 
6.1d. Le Maitre et al. (1989) originally compiled this diagram. It plots almost all the GB data points 
within the Low-K field, which is defined as tholeiitic in composition.

Figure 6.1. (a) Streckeisen classification diagram for volcanic rocks plots the rocks from the GB as basalts, basalt-andesite 
to dacite in composition. The samples that indicate dacitic composition contain increased secondary silica, interpreted to be 
a  result  of  silicification.  (b)  Nb/Y  versus  Zr/TiO2  x  0.0001  diagram  (after  Winchester  and  Floyd,  1976).  The  GB  volcanic 
rocks generally plot in the basalt field. (c) Le Maitre’s classification for volcanic rocks. The GB rocks plot within the basalt, 
basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts are distributed throughout the basalt, basaltic-
andesite  and  andesite  fields.  The  Tiebélé  samples  have  a  smaller  SiO2  range  but  some  samples  contain  increased  alkali 
concentrations and plot as trachyandesite and tephrite. The Oudalan-Gorouol belt samples plot between basalt and basaltic-
andesite. (d) SiO2 versus K2O (wt%) demonstrates that the GB volcanic rocks plot within the Low-K series for the most part. 
One sample plots in the Medium-K series with a K2O value of ~1 wt%. Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts plot within 
the Low-K series as well as the calc-alkaline fields (Medium-K, High-K series and the Shoshonite series. The Tiebélé samples 
vary between the different fields. (e) The AFM diagram plots samples from various locations. The GB volcanic rocks plot in 
the tholeiitic phase whereas the Boromo-Houndé samples are split between tholeiitic and calc-alkaline compositions which 
agrees with classifications made by Baratoux et al. (2011). The Tiebélé samples are also distributed between calc-alkaline 
and tholeiitic compositions. 
57

--- Page 58 ---
The Boromo-Houndé and Tiebélé basaltic rocks were also plotted in  Figure 6.1d. The highest 
silica  content  for  all  the  samples  was  less  than  65  wt%  SiO2.  The  maximum  K2O  value  was 
approximately 4.5 wt%. Half of the Boromo-Houndé samples plot in the Low-K series together with 
the  GB  samples.  The  remaining  samples,  originally  defined  as  calc-alkaline  basalt  and  andesite  by 
Baratoux  et  al.  (2011),  plot  in  the  calc-alkaline  fields,  including  the  Medium-K,  High-K  and 
Shoshonitic  fields.  Less  than  half  of  the  Tiebélé  basalts  plot in  the  Low-K  field,  while  the  rest  plot 
within  the  Medium-K  and  Shoshonite  series.  This  indicates  both  tholeiitic  and  calc-alkaline 
compositions for all the samples plotted. 
The  samples  from  the  GB  were  plotted  on  an  AFM  diagram.  AFM  diagrams  can  have  their 
limitations, including their petrogenetic information. This is due to the components that make up the 
trivariate diagram that collectively make up less than half of the potential chemical constituents of a 
rock.  In  addition,  because  data  are  normalised  to  100  %  in  order  to  plot  on  a  ternary  diagram, 
distortions can occur to a certain degree (Rollinson, 1993). These elements are also prone to alteration, 
therefore alteration is a cause for distortion. 
However,  the  AFM  diagram  presented  in  Figure  6.1e  plots  all  samples  from  the  GB  in  the 
tholeiitic  series.  The  data  plots  above  the  calculated  boundary  between  tholeiitic  and  calc-alkaline 
series  (Irvine  and  Baragar,  1971).  Besides  a  few  outliers,  a  trend  from  MgO  toward  FeOtotal  was 
resolved for the GB samples. The comparative data from Boromo-Houndé and Tiebélé belts primarily 
plot  within  the  tholeiitic  series,  but  samples  from  both  regions  do  show  calc-alkaline  compositions. 
This  was  observed  by  data  plotting  below  the  calc-alkaline-tholeiitie  boundary.  A  trend  from  MgO 
toward FeOtotal was resolved for the Boromo-Houndé tholeiitic basalts, which plot in the tholeiite field. 
The  Tiebélé  samples  did  not  resolve  a  trend  possibly  due  to  the  limited  sample  suite  analysed  by 
Ilboudo (2010). They were scattered throughout the calc-alkaline and tholeiitic fields. 
Harker  diagrams  were  plotted  for  samples  from  the  GB.  They  are  summarized  according  to 
trends  observed.  MgO  was  used  on  the  x-axis  rather  than  SiO2  because  the  range  of  MgO  in  mafic 
volcanic  rocks  is  much  less  than  SiO2,  avoiding  the  effect  of  distortion.  In  addition,  the  amount  of 
silica  represented  was  not  considered  reliable,  due  to  silicification  of  the  GB  samples.  MgO  is 
accepted to be relatively more immobile than SiO2 (Rollinson, 1993) and therefore able to provide an 
relatively  accurate  representation  of  the  original  MgO  wt%  of  the  rocks.  MgO  was  plotted  against 
TiO2, P2O5, SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, CaO, FeO, NiO, Cr2O3 and K2O (Figure 6.2 a-j). Both increasing and 
decreasing oxide trends are interpreted to represent periods of mineral crystallization, and termination 
of crystallization. 
Some trends resolved on the Harker diagrams exhibit better correlations than others. The MgO-
NiO plot resolvs a trend line in which NiO decreases with MgO (Figure 6.2a). This was interpreted to 
be  the result  of  the  crystallization of clinopyroxene, which consumed  Ni,  thus removing  it  from  the 
melt to the crystal structure. The slight shallowing of the NiO-MgO trend line is probably due to the 
end of clinopyroxene crystallization. 
The MgO-Cr2O3 plot (Figure 6.2b) resolved a similar trend to Figure 6.2a, and Cr2O3 decreases 
in wt% as MgO decreases. The decrease of Cr2O3 is interpreted to be the result of  crystallization of 
58

--- Page 59 ---
spinel and clinopyroxene, because Cr can occupy part of the clinopyroxene crystal lattice. The trend 
shallows,  indicating  less  Cr  was  used-up,  caused  by  a  decrease  or  halt  in  spinel  and  clinopyroxene 
crystallization. 
The MgO-CaO and MgO-Al2O3 plots exhibit directly proportional trends as the magma evolved 
(Figure 6.2c-d), i.e., proportional depletion in MgO, CaO and Al2O3. Ca is a constituent of anorthite, 
whereas Al occurs across the solid solution spectrum of plagioclase. Ca is  generally a constituent of 
apatite in basalt; due to its continuous decrease during crystallization Ca can be accommodated in the 
crystal structure of apatite in the later stages of basalt evolution. However, apatite was not observed 
during  petrographic  analyses  (Chapter  5)  and  thus  it  was  interpreted  that  the  decrease  in  CaO  and 
Al2O3 was the result of plagioclase crystallization. 
MgO-SiO2  and  MgO-TiO2  plots  resolve  similar  trends  (Figure  6.2e-f).  At  high  MgO  values, 
there are low concentrations of SiO2 and TiO2. As the melt began to crystallise, the concentration of 
SiO2  and  TiO2  increased.  Ti  is  regarded  as  being  incompatible  (Rollinson,  1993)  and  therefore 
preferentially remains in the liquid rather than partitioning into a crystal. Ti thus increases during the 
crystallization  process.  However,  at  some  stage,  TiO2  will  crystallise  within  oxide  minerals  such  as 
rutile and ilmenite, which are common oxides in basalts. 
The MgO-Na2O plot  (Figure 6.2g) displays the Na2O concentration increasing  with respect to 
MgO.  This  is  interpreted  to  be  the  result  of  the  crystallization  of  the  Na-rich  end-members  of 
plagioclase,  i.e.,  albite.  Albite  tends  to  crystallise  at  lower  temperatures  compared  to  the  Ca-rich 
anorthite (Orville, 1972); however, it is evident from the trend that most Na2O would have remained in 
the liquid. The MgO-P2O5 plot also resolves an increasing trend as MgO decreased (Figure 6.2h). This 
indicates  that  phosphate  minerals  did  not  crystallise  in  any  significant  way.  The  MgO-FeO  plot 
(Figure 6.2i) resolves an increasing FeO trend, which is typical of a liquid in which MgO fractionates 
first.  The  K2O-MgO  plot  (Figure  6.2j)  illustrates  a  poor  correlation,  where  data  points  shows  as  a 
scatter. 
6.1.2. Trace element geochemistry 
Multi-element  diagrams  were  used  to  compare  the  GB  tholeiitic  basalt  samples  to  regional 
volcanic  units  (Figure  6.3a).  The  samples  from  the  GB  were  normalised  to  chondrites  (Anders  and 
Grevesse,  1989)  and  plotted  in  an  elemental  array  after  Baratoux  et  al.  (2011).  The  tholeiitic  basalt 
samples  from  the  GB  show  similar  element  concentrations,  exhibited  by  parallel  plots  and  similar 
magnitudes. This indicates comparable trace element behaviour. A negative Ti anomaly was observed 
for  every  sample.  Rb  also  shows  low  values,  particularly  for  the  GB  and  Boromo-Houndé  samples. 
The Tiebélé basalt samples show low Rb values, but not as low as the other two sample regions. It is 
unlikely that the negative Rb values are caused by distortion, as a result of its position on the x-axis 
because it was plotted adjacent to Ba, which contains similar ionic properties. Thus Rb is probably low 
due its mobility during alteration.

Figure 6.2. Harker diagrams exhibiting crystallization trends of major elements for the GB volcanic rocks. Red dots=more 
deformed  samples;  blue  dots=less  deformed  samples  (a) The  MgO-NiO  plot  resolves  a  trend  line  in  which  NiO  decreases 
with MgO. This suggests the crystallization of clinopyroxene occurred, which consumed Ni thus removing it from the melt to 
the crystal structure. The slight shallowing of the NiO-MgO trend line is due to the closure of clinopyroxene crystallization 
(b) The MgO-Cr2O3 plot resolves a similar trend in which Cr2O3 decreases in wt% as MgO decreases. The decrease of Cr2O3 
is credited to the crystallization of spinel and clinopyroxene. The trend shallows, indicating less Cr was used up, caused by a 
decrease  or  halt  in  spinel  and  clinopyroxene  crystallization  (c,  d)  The  MgO-CaO  and  MgO-Al2O3  plots  exhibit  directly 
proportional  trends.  As  MgO  decreases,  it  was  interpreted  that CaO  and  Al2O3  decrease  as  plagioclase  crystallized  (e,  f) 
MgO-SiO2 and MgO-TiO2 plots resolve similar trends. At high MgO values, there are low concentrations of SiO2 and TiO2. 
As the melt began to evolve and fractionate, the concentration of SiO2 and TiO2 increase. TiO2 will crystallize and form oxide 
minerals  such  as  rutile  and  ilmenite  (g)  The  MgO-Na2O  plot  displays  the  Na2O  concentration  increasing  slowly  as  MgO 
concentration remained high. As the MgO concentration began to decrease, the Na2O concentration rapidly increases. This 
60

--- Page 61 ---
can be explained by the crystallization of the Na-rich end-members of plagioclase, towards the end of crystallization (h) The 
MgO-P2O5 plot also resolves an increasing trend as MgO decreases, suggesting phosphorus did not crystallise (i) The MgO-
FeO plot resolves an increasing FeO trend. It would be expected at some point in the fractionation process for Fe to partition 
into Fe-oxide minerals, explaining the decrease in FeO concentrations. (j) K2O versus MgO shows a poor correlation.  
A clearer difference is observed when comparing the tholeiitic basalts from the GB and the calc-
alkaline volcanic rocks of the Boromo-Houndé belts (Figure 6.3b). The calc-alkaline rocks report an 
enrichment of 1-2 orders of magnitude in Rb, Ba, Th, U, relative to the GB tholeiitic basalts. Despite 
this difference, Rb still displays proportionally lower values compared to Ba in both sample suites. On 
the x-axis, between Hf and Gd, there is no relative enrichment or depletion. Toward the HFS elements, 
the Boromo-Houndé samples exhibit slight depletions relative to the GB tholeiitic basalts. Overall, the 
calc-alkaline rocks  from  the  Boromo-Houndé  belts  report  a  decreasing  trend  from  Rb  toward  Lu.  A 
negative  Ti  anomaly  is  again  evident  in  all  samples.  Chondrite-normalised  multi-element  diagrams 
were  plotted  with  a  different  elemental  array  (after  Rollinson,  1993)  on  the  x-axis  (Figure  6.4a). 
Samples of tholeiitic basalt from the GB, Boromo-Houndé and the Tiebélé belts were compared. With 
this chemical array, the tholeiitic basalts report relatively similar element abundances, as revealed by 
their parallel patterns and minimal differences in magnitude between samples. Rb  is plotted adjacent 
to Ba and displays a large negative anomaly, as do P and Ti. The normalised P values for the sample 
suites range between 0.5 and 0.03. The calc-alkaline rocks show an overall decreasing trend from left 
to right on the multi-element diagram (Figure 6.4b). The GB basalt samples show an overall flat trend, 
with  the  exception  of  the  anomalies  present.  A  primitive-mantle  normalised  multi-element  diagram 
was plotted for the GB volcanic rocks (Figure 6.4c). The graph also shows a clear negative P anomaly. 
The  chemical  array  used  on  the  graph  was  taken  after  McCuaig  et  al.  (1994).  An  N-type  MORB 
normalised  (Tarney  et  al.,  1981)  multi-element  diagram  is  presented  in  Figure  6.5a.  The  elemental 
array  represents  a  transition  from  LIL  to  HFS  elements,  from  left  to  right.  The  LILE  of  the  GB 
samples are slightly more enriched than average N-type MORB compositions. The HFSE are similar 
to MORB values, with Y having a significant negative anomaly. Cr  shows scattered values, varying 
from  near  N-type  MORB  concentrations  to  values an  order  of  magnitude lower. There  is  an  overall 
decreasing  trend  from  the  LILE  to  HFSE.  The  non-normalised  Y  values  of  the  GB  samples  (see 
Appendix C) are, on average, one third of the normalising factor for N-type MORBs. Therefore, the Y 
anomaly is not considered to be an effect of distortion. Ta and P were removed from the plot for the 
GB  samples  because  they  resolve  large  positive  and  large  negative  anomalies,  respectively.  Such 
anomalies  are  reported  by  Saunders  and  Tarney  (1984)  and  Väisänen  and  Westerlund  (2007)  for 
tholeiitic  basalts  from  modern  back-arc  and  Palaeoproterozoic  terranes  in  Finland.  Tectonic 
environments can in some cases be deduced by HFSE concentrations such as Ti, Ta and Nb. The calc-
alkaline  rocks  from  the  Boromo-Houndé  belts  were  plotted  against  the  GB  samples,  while  still 
normalised  to  N-MORB  (Figure  6.5b).  Enrichment  in  Rb,  Ba  and  Th  was  noted  relative  to  the  GB 
samples, as well as negative Ti and P anomalies. The calc-alkaline samples from the Boromo-Houndé 
belts did not show Nb or Ta anomalies.

Figure 6.3 (a) Chondrite-normalised multi-element diagram comparing the tholeiitic basalts from the GB, Boromo-Houndé 
belts  and  the  Tiebélé  region.  The  sample  suites  contain  similar  trace  element  affinities  indicated  by  similar  patterns.  Rb 
exhibits  a  negative  anomaly  ranging  from  0.1to  5  times  the  chondritic  value.  Similarly,  Ti  displays  a  negative  anomaly 
ranging from 0.5 to times that of chondrite. (b) Chondrite-normalised multi-element diagram comparing the tholeiitic basalts 
of the GB with the calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of the Boromo-Houndé belts. The Boromo-Houndé data present enrichment in 
Rb, Ba, Th, U, La, Ce, Pr, Sr and Nd relative to the GB samples. This indicates that calc-alkaline rocks are more enriched in 
LIL elements relative to tholeiitic compositions. Both sample suites have similar concentrations for the remaining elements.

belts and the Tiebélé region. Similar patterns indicate similar trace element properties for the tholeiitic basalt samples from 
three regions. On this element array, Rb and Ti display negative anomalies. P exhibits a large, negative anomaly (~twice the 
size of Ti) with values ranging from ~0.03-0.5 that of chondrite. (b) Chondrite-normalised multi-element diagram comparing 
the tholeiitic basalts from the GB with the calc-alkaline volcanic rocks from the Boromo-Houndé belts. Enrichment from Ba 
to P relative to the GB samples in the calc-alkaline rocks is shown. Ba, Rb and Th show a relative enrichment of one order of 
magnitude,  indicating  significantly  different  trace  element  chemistry  for  the  sample  suites.  Although  the  sample  suites  are 
compositionally different, the P anomaly is present throughout both plots, albeit the anomaly is smaller for the calc-alkaline 
volcanic rocks. (c) Primitive mantle normalised multi-element diagram with a chemical array used in McCuaig et al. (1994) 
that  presents  negative  P  and  Ti  anomalies.  These  anomalies  are  interpreted  to  form  because  of  phosphorus  and  titanium 
retention in silicate minerals in the magma source region.

similarity between the GB rocks and the average N-type MORB concentrations. A range in concentrations exists but they do 
not deviate significantly from the N-MORB values. Rb and Cr have the widest range of concentrations (~1-20 and ~1-0.05 
the  value  of  N-MORB)  and  Y  portrays  a  negative  anomaly,  consistent  with  each  sample.  (b)  N-MORB  normalised  multi-

volcanic rocks. Ta and P are added to the x-axis. The GB tholeiitic basalts present large Ta and P anomalies, positive and 
negative, respectively. The calc-alkaline rocks present negative Ti and P anomalies.

The  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  (Figure  6.6a)  show  an  overall  flat  trend,  although 
samples  are  slightly  enriched,  or  slightly  depleted  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE.  Small  negative  Eu 
anomalies  as  well  as  positive  and  negative  Ce  anomalies  were  observed  in  some  samples.  When 
comparing  the  Tiebélé  basalts  to  the  GB  tholeiitic  basalts  (Figure  6.6b),  the  LREE  are  slightly 
enriched relative to the HREE. The majority of the Tiebélé basalts exhibit REE concentrations more 
than 10 times that of chondrite. Both negative and positive Eu anomalies occurr in the Tiebélé basalts, 
which  contrasts  with  the  GB  tholeiitic  basalts.  The  positive  anomalies  suggest  that  plagioclase 
accumulated from the melt in high enough abundance to allow for positive Eu concentrations. 
The REE patterns for the tholeiitic basalts from the Boromo-Houndé belts are similar to the GB 
(Figure 6.6b). They possess a flat overall trend coupled with minor enrichment or depletion. They are 
5 to 14 times that of chondrites. The Boromo-Houndé samples do not show Eu anomalies.

value, whereas the HREE range between ~9 and 20  times chondrite. Some samples present slight depletions, while others 
present  slight  enrichments  from  LREE  to  HREE.  (b)  Chondrite-normalised  REE  diagram  comparing  the  GB,  Boromo-

present  enrichment  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE  compared  to  the  tholeiitic  compositions,  resulting  in  a  decreasing  trend. 
Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline volcanic rocks have La values range from ~30-80 time chondrite and Lu between ~6 and 12 
times chondrite. Negative Eu anomalies are present.

The GB tholeiitic basalts and the Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline lavas areplotted in Figure 6.6c 
and  demonstrated  a  noticeable  enrichment  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE  for  the  calc-alkaline  volcanic 
rocks. The La values vary between 21 and 60 times chondrites, all of which were larger than the GB 
La values. The (La/Yb)CHON for the GB tholeiitic basalts range from 0.65 to 3.14, whereas the ratio for 
the calc-alkaline volcanics range from 2.44-5.27. A large enrichment indicates a slightly more evolved 
melt,  typical  of  calc-alkaline  compositions  (Saunders  and  Tarney,  1984),  as  would  be  expected. 
Negative Eu anomalies are observed for samples H03 and H09, which are significantly larger than that 
of  the  tholeiitic  basalts.  This  suggests  that  either  more  plagioclase  retention  occurred  in  the  residue 
during melting or plagioclase fractionation occurred and was then removed. 
Tectonic discrimination diagrams are used in this study to provide some indication as to the type 
of tectonic setting that existed at the time the basalts were erupted. For older geological terranes, these 
diagrams  are  best  used  in  conjunction  with  other  sources  of  evidence  such  as  geochemistry, 
lithological relationships and petrographic studies to improve confidence in interpretation (Rollinson, 
1993). 
The  relatively  immobile  HFS  elements  (Zr,  Ti,  Nb,  Y  and  P)  are  ideal  elements  to  use  when 
attempting to discriminate between different settings. They are considered to withstand the effects of 
hydrothermal, seawater and metamorphic alteration up to middle amphibolite facies (Rollinson, 1993; 
White,  2013).  Consequently,  the  Ti-Zr-Y  plot  (Figure  6.7a),  a  binary  plot  which  uses  Zr  versus  Ti 
(ppm) (Figure 6.7b), and a Zr-Nb-Y ternary discrimination plot (Figure 6.9c) were chosen to represent 
possible tectonic environments into which the basalts of the GB were erupted. 
The Ti-Zr-Y plot (Figure 6.7a) is able to differentiate ‘within-plate’ basalts from other tectonic 
environments.  However,  it  is  not  the  most  useful  diagram  when  it  came  to  discriminating  between 
MORB,  island-arc  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  basalts  because  these  fields  overlap  on  the 
diagram.  Regardless,  the  majority  of  data  for  the  GB  plot  within  the  field  of  MORB,  island-arc 
tholeiitic basalts and calc-alkaline basalts, eliminating the possibility of a ‘within-plate’ environment. 
The remaining samples plot outside the field boundary. 
The  binary  diagram  (Figure  6.7b),  which  used  Zr  versus  Ti  (ppm),  was  the  most  ambiguous 
discrimination  diagram  because  it  shows  significant  tectonic  field  overlap.  The  GB  samples  plot 
within  the  field  described  by  MORB,  island-arc  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  basalts,  but  the 
majority of samples plot in the MORB only field, with one sample close to MORB in the calc-alkaline 
field. However, Figure 6.7b indicates a strong possibility for the presence of MORB. 
The  GB  sample  data  was  also  plotted  on  a  Zr-Nb-Y  ternary  discrimination  diagram  (Figure 
6.7c)  (after  Meschede,  1986)  in  order  to  characterize  the  various  types  of  MORB  and  identify 
volcanic-arc basalts (Rollinson, 1993). The GB samples plot well within the field that represents the 
tectonic  setting  of  N-type  MORB  or  volcanic  arc  basalts.  There  was  a  weak  correlation  resolved 
amongst the data points trending from higher to lower Y concentrations. As Y decreased, Zr and Nb 
increased slightly.

most of the GB volcanic rocks are MORB, island arc tholeiite or calc-alkaline basalt. Two outliers, although clustered with 
the data, do not plot in a tectonic field. (b) Binary discrimination diagram that plots Zr versus Ti (ppm). A good correlation

island arc tholeiites; therefore, no definitive tectonic setting can be established from this graph. (c) A ternary discrimination 
diagram (2Nb, Y and Zr/4 ) that follows from Figure 6.7b. The GB samples plot well within field D. Field D categorizes the 
data either as N-type MORB or volcanic-arc basalts. The data represents a linear trend, becoming more enriched in Zr and 
Nb or Y.

7. INTERPRETATIONS AND DISCUSSION 
7.1. Depositional Environment and Interpretations 
The intercalated, conformable succession and spatial distributions of the lithologies  of the GB 
indicate  simultaneous  deposition  of  sedimentary  and  volcanic  rocks.  The  lithologies  represent 
proximal  to  distal  depositional  facies  relative  to  a  volcanic  source  region  (Figure  7.1).  The 
depositional  environment  and  spatial  distributions  were  constrained  using  volcanic  and  sedimentary 
textures, lithological relationships, mineralogies and alteration types. 
7.1.1. Volcanic rocks of the southern Goren belt 
The  basaltic  rocks  of  the  GB  present  textural  evidence  that  distinguishes  subaqueous  from 
subaerial extrusion. This evidence includes hyaloclastic brecciation, high concentrations of amygdales 
and  vesicles,  an  abundance  of  pillow  lavas,  and  volcano-sedimentary  lithological  relationships. 
Lithological relationships include siltstone intercalations within the volcanic sequences and turbiditic 
greywacke  sequences.  These  textures  suggest  a  subaqueous  environment  was  present  during  basin 
formation. 
Pillow  lavas  are  a  significant  environmental  indicator  for  eruption  settings.  The  formation  of 
pillow  lavas  often  suggests  that  eruptions  occurred  under  water.  They  are  associated  with  low 
discharge rates of magma and/or extrusion onto low gradient slopes (Griffiths and Fink, 1992). Pillow 
lavas of the southern GB are interpreted to have formed in relatively shallow water, due to their high 
vesicle abundance, and perhaps only a few hundred meters water depth (cf. Jones, 1969). The vesicles 
indicate  movement  of  gas  toward  flow  boundaries,  particularly  the  top  of  flow  units;  for  example, 
Archaean subaqueous basalts in Quebec were identified by Dimroth et al. (1978) with an abundance of 
vesicles  positioned  towards  the  upper  margins  of  flow  units  and  less  abundant  in  the  flow/pillow 
interior. However, the accumulation of vesicles is not unique to subaqueous flows.  In subaerial lava 
flows,  such  as  pahoehoe  lavas,  the  vesicles  differ  in  size,  shape  and  accumulation  (McPhie  et  al., 
1993),  with  no  accumulation  in  any  particular  part  of  the  flow,  but  with  random  distribution,  and 
vesicles are large. 
Volcanic  textures,  lithofacies  and  mineralogies  are  critical  when  determining  volcanic  facies. 
Porphyritic,  aphyric,  glassy,  variolitic  and  amygdaloidal  textures  indicate  that  the  GB  basaltic 
sequences  represent  coherent  units.  They  make  up  a  large  proportion  of  the  volcanic  facies 
architecture of the study area. 
The  hyaloclastic  basalts  of  the  southern  GB  are  characterized  by  angular  basaltic  fragments 
surrounded by an altered, fine-grained matrix. Hyaloclastite basalts in general, form most commonly

in  low  viscosity  lavas  and  are  a  product  of  non-explosive,  in-situ,  quench  fragmentation.  Quench 
fragmentation is a result of the immediate contact between cold water and hot lava (Lajoie and Stix,  
1992; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). Basaltic liquid is known to erupt at temperatures in excess of 950 °C 
(Green  and  Ringwood,  1967)  making  the  thermal  difference  between  seawater  and  lava  possibly  in 
excess  of  900  °C.  It  is  interpreted  that  the  basalts  of  the  southern  GB  extruded  directly  onto  the 
seafloor. 
The  hyaloclastite  units  represent  an  autoclastic  facies,  which  is  commonly  observed  as 
intercalated,  transitional  units  within  the  coherent  units  in  the  southern  GB.  Summarily,  autoclastic 
units share a close spatial relationship with the coherent units (McPhie et al., 1993). 
Porphyritic  and  aphyric  textures  are  characteristic  of  coherent  units.  They  represent 
crystallisation processes within the magma chamber prior to eruption (McPhie et al., op cit.).  In the 
GB,  aphyric  textures  are  ubiquitous  (thus coherent  units)  and  represented  by  uniformly  fine-grained 
plagioclase and clinopyroxene that were altered to chlorite, actinolite and epidote. Coherent volcanic 
lithofacies include  massive, pillowed, tortoise-shell jointed, variolitic and flow banded basalts. They 
occurred  in  conjunction  with  aphyric,  amygdaloidal  and  less  commonly  variolitic  and  porphyritic 
basalts, which further validate the coherence of the units.  
Varioles form due to liquid immiscibility caused during cooling of lavas. However, in old rocks 
they can be misleading. Arndt and Fowler (2004) suggested that varioles are best used as descriptive 
terms in the field as they are often misinterpreted as accretionary lapilli, amygdales, magma  mixing 
textures  or  altered  phenocrysts.  Arndt  and  Fowler  (op  cit.)  suggested  that  varioles,  which  form  by 
liquid  immiscibility  in  Archaean  and  Palaeoproterozoic  rocks,  are  actually  quite  rare.  They  require 
further geochemical examination to determine their formation process. 
In  general,  flow  banding  can  occur  in  basalt  (Expedition  309  Scientists,  2005),  despite  being 
more  commonly  observed  in  felsic  lavas  such  as  dacite  and  rhyolite.  The  distinct  variation  in 
composition  suggests  preferential  mineral accumulation  occurred, thus  creating compositional  bands 
(leucocratic  and  melanocratic  bands).  Although  considered  rare  in  mafic,  non-viscous  lavas,  flow 
banding has been recorded in the Archaean Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa (Robbins et al., 
2010) and occurs in the southern Bouroum belt in Burkina Faso (WAXI, 2013) (Figure 1.1). 
The  coherent  and  autoclastic  units  of  the  study  area  formed  as  a  result  of  effusive  eruptions. 
Effusive eruptions are typical of basaltic liquids, particularly when submerged beneath the confining 
water column. Effusive eruptions are characterized by the ability of lava to flow (low viscosity) rather 
than explode (Parfitt and Wilson, 2008) because volatiles escape passively through vesicle formation 
(McPhie et al., 1993; Bardintzeff and McBirney, 2000; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). 
The  coherent  and  autoclastic  facies  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  proximally  to  the  volcanic 
source. However, because basaltic lavas have low viscosities, they are able to flow laterally between 
tens and hundreds of metres before solidification. This is dependent on the gradient of the sea floor, 
morphology of the lava and cooling rate (Smellie and Hole, 1997). Thus it is reasonable to suggest that 
74

--- Page 75 ---
the GB basalts could have extended into an intermediate facies, further away from the volcanic  vent 
from which they were erupted. 
7.1.2. Sedimentary rocks of the south Goren belt 
Conformable  sedimentary  sequences  are  intercalated  with  basalt  flows  in  the  stratigraphic 
sequence  of  the  southern  GB.  These  include  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sediments,  siltstone, 
volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit. 
Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  common  in  the  southern  GB  (Section  4.3.5; 
Hein  et  al.,  2004)  and,  in  fact,  throughout  the  WAC  (Section  1.1;  Blanchot  et  al.,  1972;  Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Neumann, 1988; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008; Beauvais 
et al., 2008). They are also reported from a number of Palaeoproterozoic terranes in India (Roy, 1968; 
1973,  1981;  Roy  and  Purkait,  1968),  Guyana  (Choubert,  1973)  and  South  Africa  (Gutzmer  and 
Buekes, 1996; Eriksson et al., 1993; Beyeme Zogo, 2010). 
The  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  from  the  southern  GB  are  commonly 
intercalated with basaltic units and/or siltstone-volcaniclastite units (Section 4.3.5). These rocks have 
elevated Ba concentrations (Chapter 6.2) and disseminated pyrite, chalcopyrite, braunite, iron-oxides, 
native  Au  and  quartz-carbonate  vein  systems  (Section  5.2.3),  all  of  which  resemble  volcanogenic 
manganese  deposits  described  by  (Constantinou  and  Govett,  1972;  Mosier  and  Page,  1988).  The 
formation  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  is  indicative  of  the  formation  of  VHMS  deposits. 
Hydrothermal fluids permeate through fractures, leaching metals from the underlying basalt (Lydon, 
1988).  The  metal  assemblages  in  VHMS  and  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  commonly  include 
Cu-Zn-Pb-Ag-(Au)  and  Mn-Fe-(Au)  (Mosier  and  Page,  1988).  With  respect  to  the  GB,  the 
volcanogenic system included Cu, Fe, Mn and minor Au, but lacked Pb-Zn. Additionally, the southern 
GB  is  dominated  by  secondary  manganese  oxides  as  veins,  breccias,  tablets  and  colloform 
overgrowths  (Sections  4.3.5  and  5.2.3).  These  overprinting  textures  resemble  typical  supergene 
alteration  found  in  the  Kuruman  manganese  deposits  in  the  Transvaal  Supergroup  of  South  Africa 
(Beyeme  Zogo,  2010),  suggesting  that  the  volcanogenic  system  underwent  supergene  alteration  at 
some stage. 
The  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  of  the  GB  resemble  the  Cyprus-type  volcanogenic 
manganese deposits defined by Mosier and Page (1988). Cyprus-type deposits occur as lenticular units 
bounded  between  volcanic  and  volcaniclastic  rocks,  and  can  be  proximal  to  distal  to  the  volcanic 
source. It is probably the case for the GB that the Mn-Fe-rich, carbonaceous sedimentary rocks formed 
as  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  in  a  proximal  to  distal  volcanic  setting.  A  distal  setting  is 
indicated  by  low  Ba  concentrations,  fine-laminations  with  thin  ferruginous  chert,  and  dolomite 
interbeds, while a proximal setting is indicated because some Mn-Fe-rich units present an increase in 
oxides and Ba concentrations and increased base metal values. 
75

--- Page 76 ---
A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005).  For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. 
The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character.  For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages 
that  are  volcanogenic.  Additionally, 
the  manganese-
carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary 
sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting.  Furthermore  the 
Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich 
carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005).  There  is  thus  a  strong  correlation 
between  primary  manganese  mineralization  in  the  WAC  and  a  volcanic  setting,  with  a  potential  for 
exploitable resources of base metals and primary manganese. The Tambão deposit has an exploitable 
reserve  of  15  Mt  of  manganese  ore  divided  between  primary  and  supergene  manganese  resources 
(Colin et al., 2005). 
The  greywacke  units  of  the  GB  are  characterized  by  trough  cross  bedding,  upward-fining 
sequences,  scour  and  fill,  thin  conglomerate  interbeds,  flame  structures,  chert  interbeds,  mud  clasts 
and  mud  drapes  (Section  4.3.3)  which  indicates  that  deposition  took  place  in  a  marginal  marine  to 
offshore  environment  (Fischer  and  Schmincke,  1994;  Boggs,  2006).  The  greywacke  units  best 
represent  a  prograding  delta  front  adjacent  to  a  shelf  margin.  This  is  supported  by  fining  upwards 
sequences interpreted to represent various incomplete, small-scale Bouma sequences (Bouma, 1962). 
Turbidite flows can account for large  volumes of sediment deposition in a short period of time, thus 
explaining the thick succession in the GB, relative to thicknesses of other lithologies. The presence of 
conglomerate beds and mud clasts, possibly due to rip-up action within the greywacke units suggests 
energetic and erosive deposition (Walker, 1992). 
The greywacke units of the GB are composed of coarse-grained, angular to sub-rounded quartz, 
plagioclase  and  intact  clinopyroxene  grains  (Sections  4.3.3,  5.2.1).  Clinopyroxene  and  plagioclase 
grains are readily altered during transportation processes (Albarede, 2003), suggesting that deposition 
of the greywackes in the southern GB took place proximal to the source. Consequently, the greywacke 
was likely derived from a volcano-(plutonic) source nearby.  
The pyroclastic breccia unit of the GB is a polylithic, poorly bedded, poorly sorted deposit that 
is interbedded within the greywacke succession (Section 4.3.4). The breccia is composed of euhedral 
quartz,  plagioclase,  volcanic  hornblende  and  anhedral  clinopyroxene  crystals  cemented  with  a  fine-
grained epidote-sericite rich matrix (Section 5.2.2). The euhedral mineralogy, coupled with the lack of 
76

--- Page 78 ---
partitioned  into  clinopyroxene.  Plagioclase  is  occasionally  identified  as  phenocrysts  and  more  so  as 
microlites (Sections 4.2 and 5.1), explaining the decreasing trends in the GB samples from this study. 
FeO and SiO2 content increased as MgO decreased, typical of tholeiitic evolution (Rollinson, 1993). 
Trace element results show notable anomalies. The large, negative phosphorus observed in the 
chondrite-normalised and primitive mantle-normalised multi-element diagrams (Figures 6.5 b-c) of the 
GB  samples  was  indeed  surprising.  However,  it  is  a  common  occurrence  in  Archaean  and 
Palaeoproterozoic basalts (Prof. A. H. Wilson, pers. comm.). These anomalies have been observed in a 
variety  of  mafic-intermediate  volcanic  rocks  throughout  the  WAC  (WAXI,  2013)  although  their 
meaning has not been studied to date. 
It is unlikely that the decrease in phosphorus in the GB samples was the result of hydrothermal 
alteration  and  metamorphic  processes  due  to  the  known  immobility  of  phosphorus  during  low 
temperature  processes  (Rollinson,  1993;  McCuaig  et  al.,  1994)  Due  to  a  correlation  of  MgO  versus 
P2O5 in the variation diagram plotted for the GB samples (Figure 6.2 h), where P2O5 increases as MgO 
decreases,  the  interpretation  is  that  hydrothermal  alteration  had  little  or  no  effect.  Therefore,  it  is 
suggested that Ca-perovskite and garnet were retained in the magma source as suggested by McCuaig 
et  al.  (1994)  for  Archaean  basalts  from  the  Yilgarn  and  Superior  Cratons.  They  calculated  partition 
coefficients  for  phosphorus  and  reported  that  phosphorus  is  more  likely  to  substitute  for  silica  in 
garnet,  clinopyroxene  and  Ca-perovskite,  and  determined  that  phosphorus  partitioned  into  Ca-
perovskite  >  majorite  garnet  >  pyrope  garnet  >  clinopyroxene  with  negligible  amounts  partitioning 
into olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel.  
In attempt to quantify the likelihood of phosphorus retention in the magma source in general for 
GB samples, a simple calculation was done (Appendix C) to determine how much  phosphorus could 
be retained in garnet and clinopyroxene in ancient magmas. The assumption was made that 0.05 wt% 
P2O5 was present in these magmas and 15 % partial melting occurred. The primitive mantle value for 
phosphorus was taken from Anders and Grevesse (1989). Partion coefficient values of phosphorus for 
clinopyroxene  and  garnet  are  approximately  0.025  and  0.04  respectively  (Rollinson,  1993).  It  was 
calculated  that  garnet  and  clinopyroxene  could  retain  approximately  272  ppm  of  phosphorus.  This 
quantity is supported  by  Brunet and Chazot (2001) on phosphorus retention in mantle nodules  from 
the upper mantle. Their calculations indicated that garnet, clinopyroxene and olivine can retain up to 
600 ppm of phosphorus. These calculated phosphorus values confirm that phosphorus retention in the 
magma source is plausible. However, further studies on phosphorus anomalies needs to be undertaken 
from  individual  terranes  across  the  WAC  in  order  to  create  a  petrogenetic  model  with  reference  to 
modern  and  ancient  tholeiites.  Another  possibility  for  such  anomalous  phosphorus  could  be  due  to 
carbonate  alteration.  Phosphate  bearing  minerals  such  as  apatite  do dissolve  readily  in  acidic fluids, 
even with relatively weak acidity (Prof. G. Cawthorn, Pers. Comm.). 
The comparison between the tholeiitic basalts from the southern GB with those from the Tiebélé 
and  Boromo-Houndé  belts,  and  calc-alkaline  mafic-intermediate  rocks  of  the  Boromo-Houndé  belts 
78

--- Page 79 ---
indicate a clear difference in trace element behaviour. The calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of the Boromo-
Houndé belts are interpreted by Baratoux et al. (2011) to represent an island-arc tectonic setting. The 
calc-alkaline  rocks  showed  enrichments  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE  (Figure  6.6)  and  enrichments  in 
Rb,  Ba,  Th  and  other  LILE  relative  to  those  seen  in  the  tholeiitic  basalts  (Figure  6.3b).  The 
enrichments can be explained because LREE are considerably more incompatible relative to HREE. 
However, although Rb and Nb are of similar incompatibility during mantle melting they do not share 
this  affinity  during  alteration,  Rb  is  more  mobile.  LFSE  to  HFSE  ratio  in  arc-related  magmas  are 
increased because fluid rom the subducted slab causes mantle wedge metasomatism. This was shown 
by Pearce (1983) and Pearce and Peate (1995). LREE are more incompatible than HREE, however, it 
does  not  indicate  that  LILE  are  more  incompatible  than  all  HFSE  as  it  depends  on  the  LILE  and 
HFSE.  This  idea suggests that  although  the  samples from  the  Boromo-Houndé belts  are  most  likely 
calc-alkaline arc-ddervied lavas, enriched LILE to HFSE may not be conclusive evidence on its own 
to  support  the  conclusions  drawn  by  Baratoux  et  al.  (2011);  fractionation  of  various  trace  elements 
relative to each should be studied further.  
Volcanic arcs, inclusive of tholeiitic and calc-alkaline compositions, result from melting caused 
by  a  cold  and  dense  subducting  slab  which  undergoes  dehydration-induced  melting.  During 
subduction and dehydration, water and HFSE move into the mantle wedge providing arc-magmas with 
their  geochemical  signature.  However,  rutile  stabilses  in  the  slab  and  allows  for  ceratin  immobile 
elements  to  be  retained  in  the  subducting  slab,  or  the  sub-arc  mantle  wedge  (Ryerson  and  Watson, 
1987;  Foley  and  Wheller,  1990;  Saunders  et  al.,  1991;  Bau  and  Knittel,  1993;  Sajona  et  al.,  1993; 
Kepezhinskas  et  al.,  1997).  Thus,  volcanic  rocks  from  volcanic  arc  terranes  are  characterized  by 
depletions in Ta, Nb and Ti relative to tholeiitic MORB.  The GB samples contain large positive Ta 
anomalies  and  no  Ti  or  Nb  anomalies  are  apparent  when  normalised  to  average  N-MORB 
compositions. In contrast, the Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline samples have negative Ti anomalies and 
smooth  patterns  for  Nb  and  Ta  (Figure 6.5b).  The  differences in Ti  and Ta  suggest  that  the  magma 
underwent processes unlikely to be derived from the same source. By comparing the data from the GB 
tholeiitic basalts with data from the calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of the Boromo-Houndé belts, it is also 
possible  that  the  GB  basalts  were  emplaced  in  a  back-arc/intra-arc  relative  to  the  arc  (Figure  7.2). 
Alternatively,  hydrated  MORB  can  stabilise  Ti  in  Ti-bearing  minerals  as  is  seen  at  the  modern 
Galapagos  and  EPR  which  gives  arc-type  geochemical  signatures.  This  has  significance  in  bimodal 
volcan environments (Haase et al., 2005) 
The flat REE patterns and various multi-element diagrams observed for the GB display trends 
similar to tholeiitic basalts that are typical of mid-ocean ridge type settings (Rollinson, 1993; Väisänen 
and Westerlund, 2007; White, 2013). The basalts of the southern GB possess many characterisitics of 
tholeiitic  mid-ocean  ridge  basalts (MORB),  specifically  normal  MORB  (N-MORB)  as  defined  from 
trace elements compositions (Figures 6.7); rare earth, multi element and trace element analyses of the 
GB  samples  (Section  6.1.2).  They  also  share  some  characterisitcs  that  are  derived  from  convergent 
79

--- Page 80 ---
zones and are thus interpreted to form in  extentional terranes such as back arc or intra-arc basins as 
possible tectonic settings. The data are characteristic of back-arc and/or intra-arc basin basalts (Taylor 
and Karner, 1983; Saunders and Tarney, 1984; Wilson, 1989).  
Figure 7.2. Schematic diagram depicting Ta, Ti and Nb signatures relative to MORB values in a volcanic-arc environment. 
These values present the similarities between back-arc and intra-arc terranes as well as the differences between retro-arc 
and  volcanic  arc  trace  element  geochemistry.  The  dotted  line  indicates  the  concentrations  that  are  expected  across  the 
tectonic setting based on literature and the red line represents observed concentrations using data from the Goren belt and 
the Boromo-Houndé belts (interpreted back-arc/intra-arc and arc environments respectively). 
80

--- Page 81 ---
Petrographically,  lithologically  and  geochemically,  back-arc  and/or  intra-arc  basin  basalts 
settings are extremely difficult to distinguish, especially in ancient terranes  (Pearce, 1996;  Väisänen 
and Westerlund, 2007). It was suggested by Pearce (1996) that back-arc and/or intra-arc basin basalts 
should be referred to as transitional between back-arc basin basalts and intra-arc tholeiites (IAT) when 
geochemical  evidence  cannot  ascertain  the  correct  tectonic  setting.  This  has  been  that  rationale 
adopted in this thesis. 
7.3. The Goren belt in a regional context 
In  northeast  Burkina  Faso,  geochemical  analyses  of  of  volcanic  rocks  from  various  belts, 
including the Oudalan-Gorouol, Bouroum-Yalogo and Goren volcano-sedimentary belts suggest that 
deposition of supracrustal rocks occurred in island arc terranes, followed by the accretion of multiple 
arcs (WAXI,  2013).  Vidal  et  al.  (2009)  suggested  these  terranes  were  deposited  concomitantly  with 
the emplacement of the TTG plutons (2250-2170 Ma) across the WAC, and represent the lowermost 
part  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  stratigraphic  succession.  In  the  GB,  supracrustal  deposition  of 
Birimian  Supergroup  occurred  prior  to  TTG  emplacement  (Hein  et  al.,  2004;  Hein  2010;  WAXI, 
2013).  
Research conducted by Dia (1988), Lüdtke et al. (1998), Béziat et al. (2000) and Dampare et al. 
(2008) concluded that tholeiitic and calc-alkaline volcanic rocks are characteristic of juvenile volcanic 
arc systems. However, studies by Abouchami et al. (1990), including work from the Bouroum belt in 
Burkina  Faso, suggested that the  best  tectonic  analogue  for the  formation  of  tholeiitic  basalts  of  the 
Birimian  Supergroup  is  oceanic  flood  basalts  (OFB).  This  conclusion  was  established  from  Ti  and 
LREE  depletions,  where  the  LREE  depletion  is  less  than  N-type  MORBs.  It  was  suggested  that  an 
intermediate  geochemistry  between  back-arc  basins  and  island-arc  tholeiites  made  such  an 
environment an attractive setting, especially due to regionally low Nb concentrations (Zonou, 1987), 
but  the  lack  of  ultramafic  rocks  (Burke,  1988)  and  unfitting  isotopic  and  trace  element  signatures 
indicated an oceanic plateau origin (Abouchami et al., 1990). 
The distinction between the GB basalt samples forming in an arc-related basin compared to an 
oceanic plateau setting is in their strato-tectonic context. The tholeiitic basalts from the GB have many 
similarities to the general tholeiitic compositions from around the craton. These similarities include the 
reporting of negative normalised Ti and Nb anomalies (Figure 6.5), but the GB basalts are not depleted 
in  LREE  relative  to  HREE  (Figure  6.6),  making  them  more  enriched  in  LREE  compared  to 
Palaeoproterozoic OFB. Thus the GB basalts are not OFB. 
With  respect  to  the  sedimentary  rocks  that  are  intercalated  with  the  tholeiitic  basalts, 
Abouchami et al. (1990) stated that sedimentary rocks do not host obvious reworked components. The 
GB has direct evidence to oppose this idea as it is composed of a conformable sequence of arc-derived 
volcaniclastic greywacke deposits, siltstones and pyroclastite breccia, which are more likely to have 
81

deposited in a back-arc or intra-arc basin, proximal-distal to a pre-existing island-arc terrane (Figure 
7.3). Thus the GB basalts are unlikely to be OFB. 
The  Birimian  Supergroup  has  been  compared  to  Archaean  granite-greenstone  terranes  due  to 
their  similar  lithologies  and  temporal  relationship  between  supracrustal  and  granitoids  emplacement 
(Bassot, 1986; N’Gom, 1989). The tholeiitic basalts are typically overlain by calc-alkaline lavas and 
associated sedimentary rocks and pyroclastites (Hottin and Ouedraogo, 1975; Zonou, 1987) in some 
belts (WAXI, 2013). The calc-alkaline volcanic rocks, are commonly intruded by TTG suite plutons 
throughout  the  WAC  and  post-date  the  eruption  of  tholeiitic  lavas  (Melcher  and  Stumpfl,  1992; 
WAXI,  2013).  Various  conclusions  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  stratigraphy  have  been  reached  by 
Junner (1935, 1940), Leube et al. (1990), Ledru et al.  (1991), Milési et al. (1989, 1991), Hein et al. 
(2004),  Hein  (2010)  and  Baratoux  et  al.  (2011),  but  the  GB  is  interpreted  to  be  an  intercalated 
succession  of  volcanic  and  sedimentary  rocks  (Hein,  2010),  which  is  confirmed  in  this  study. 
Although  the  GB  is  represented  by  large  quantities  of  MORB  tholeiites,  the  differently-sourced 
pyroclastic  agglomerate  interbeds  suggest  a  distinct  period  of  localised  bimodal  volcanism. 
Essentially, whilst the GB arc-basin was infilling with lavas and sediments, arc eruptions and erosion 
off the arc were depositing into the basin simultaneously, supporting the model of Leube et al. (1990) 
and  Sylvester  and  Attoh  (1992).  This  indicates  that  the  tectonic  setting  for  the  GB  was  probably  a 
back-arc. 
Regionally, Leube et al. (1990) identified that the Mn-Fe-rich carbonaceous sedimentary rocks, 
chert,  carbon,  carbonate  and  sulphide  rich-rocks  precipitated  syn-volcanically,  often  proximal  to 
volcanic edifices. This is identified in the GB as intercalated  Mn-Fe-rich carbonaceous sedimentary-
tholeiitic  basaltic  units  and  evidence  of  syn-volcanic  hydrothermal  activity  identified  as  quartz-
carbonate veins, Fe-Mn oxide veins, and Ba anomalies. 
7.4. The Goren belt and the West African craton in a global context 
On a global scale the Palaeoproterozoic is an era in which the formation of accretionary island 
arc systems, development of large sedimentary basins and crustal growth were dominant (de Vries et 
al.,  2008).  However,  research  in  the  WAC  over  the  last  two  decades  has  shifted  paradigms  of 
stratigraphic-tectonic-magmatic-metallogenic-structural  understanding.  The  Birimian  Supergroup  is 
defined by volcano-sedimentary belts rather than greenstone belts (WAXI, 2013; Tshibubudze et al., 
2013), which (sensu stricto) commonly contain mafic volcanic components making up the majority of 
the  belt,  with  subordinate  sedimentary  units.  The  volcano-sedimentary  belts  likely  formed  in  arc-
related basin (back-arc or intra-arc basin) that underwent periods of extension, inducing tholeiitic lavas 
similar to MORB. 
The  formation  of  island-arcs  provide  similar  volcanic  and  sedimentary  products  from  various 
locations.  Volcanism,  particularly  arc-related,  is  reported  from  many  Palaeoproterozoic  terranes 
82

including  Finland,  Australia,  Mid-West  United  States  and  Canada  (Stern  et  al.,  1995;  Hill  and 
Bickford, 2001; Väisänen and Westerlund, 2007; Li et al., 2013). The volcanic facies are similar due 
to  analogous  depositional  environments,  many  of  which  are  mineralised  in  volcanogenic  massive 
sulphides.

8. CONCLUSIONS 
8.1. Summary and conclusions 
Lithological  and  volcanic  facies  maps  were  created  using  data  collected  during  multiple  field 
seasons. The rocks of the GB were affected by regional sub-greenschist to greenschist metamorphism. 
The  stratigraphy  is  represented  by  a  conformable  succession  of  sub-vertically  dipping,  northwest-
trending volcanic flows intercalated with sequences of sedimentary rocks. These include siltstone, Mn-
Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks,  epiclastic  greywacke  units,  basalt-derived  volcaniclastic 
units  and  a  discrete  pyroclastic  interbed.  Conformable  sequences  were  identified  by  gradational 
contacts in the field. 
Field,  petrographic  and  geochemical  analyses  were  used  to  classify  the  volcanic  rocks  as 
basalts.  Further  geochemistry  and  mineralogical  analyses  established  a  tholeiitic  composition.  This 
was  based  on  the  sub-alkaline  Na2O-K2O  values,  SiO2,  MgO,  Al2O3  concentrations  and  low  modal 
abundances of the primary minerals, namely plagioclase and clinopyroxene, which typically occur as 
microlites. Trace element analyses, including REE and multi-element patterns show a strong similarity 
to tholeiitic N-MORB. This indicated that the tectonic setting was an extensional basin. Lithological 
and  spatial  relationships,  comparative  work  with  known  arc-related  calc-alkaline  andesites  from  the 
Boromo-Houndé belts, as well as trace element tectonic discrimination indicate deposition in an arc-
related  basin  (back-arc  or  intra-arc  basin)  that  underwent  periods  of  extension,  inducing  tholeiitic 
basakts with MORB geochemical affinities. 
Analyses  of  volcanic  textures  resulted  in  the  delineation  of  volcanic  facies  architecture.  The 
volcanic  rocks  are  dominated  by  coherent  units.  This  was  based  on  the  occurrence  of  porphyritic, 
aphyric, aphanitic, amygdaloidal and variolitic textures, as well as flow banded, tortoise-shell jointed, 
massive and pillowed basalt lithofacies. Intercalated with the coherent basalts were autoclastic facies 
characterized  by  (jig-saw  fit)  hyaloclastite  breccia  flows.  Pillow  lavas,  hyaloclastites,  the  size  and 
abundance of amygdales and intercalated siltstones indicated subaqueous emplacement in a marginal 
marine setting. Spatially, both the coherent and autoclastic facies represent a proximal facies.  
Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  formed  syn-volcanically  proximal  to  the  source, 
indicating  a  proximal  facies  distribution.  They  are  finely  laminated,  chert-bearing  and  contain 
volcaniclastite and carbonate interbeds. They are differentiated from proximal  volcanogenic deposits 
due to lower Ba and higher carbon concentrations with little evidence to suggest unusual amounts of 
base metals (Cu, Pb, Zn).  
Continuous  successions  of  volcanogenic  greywacke  deposits  occupy  a  distal  facies relative  to 
the volcanic source. They conformably  overly older volcano-sedimentary lithologies and represent a 
marginal marine to offshore deltaic-turbiditic depositional environment. This interpretation was based 
85

on  fining  upwards  sequences,  trough  cross-bedding,  ripple  marks,  scour  and  fill  structures,  mud 
clasts\balls, mud drapes and conglomerate beds. Their source region is concluded to be land-derived as 
opposed  to  basin  derived.  Intercalated  within  the  greywacke  succession  is  a  pyroclastic  deposit 
containing euhedral lapilli of quartz, plagioclase and hornblende cemented in a fine to medium grained 
ash-lapilli sized matrix. Its derivation is interpreted as a volcanic arc source, depositing in a back-arc 
or intra-arc basin, thus indicating bimodal volcanism in the GB. 
Potential  for  economic  Mn  and  Fe  mineralisation  exists.  An  example  of  one  such  deposit  is 
Tambão hill near the Malian border, northeast of the GB. It is also plausible for the GB to contain base 
metal deposits, such as VHMS deposits. However, the sample suite collected in the GB do not suggest 
high enough concentrations of base metals (Pb-Zn-Cu and Au) to define VHMS deposits. However, 
based on the similarities of deposit styles, they could potentially exist in the GB and other belts on the 
WAC such as the already discovered Perkoa deposit and Tiebélé dome.
