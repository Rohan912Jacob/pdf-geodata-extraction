located  in  the  Kolondieba  belt,  where  the  high  density  coincides  to  the  high  susceptibility. The 
coincidence of high susceptibility and high density corresponds to gneissic rocks identified with the 
surface  rock  petrophysics  measurements. Area  2  is  located  in  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  is  also 
interpreted as a gneissic rock volume. 46 || This was established 
by Wijns (2009) in a comparative study between the magnetic and electromagnetic methods as used in 
the Syama belt. His work showed that intrusive bodies, which are indistinct in the magnetic data, are 
readily resolved from electromagnetic data. The host rocks in the Syama belt are highly conductive 
because of graphite in the host rocks, relative to the intrusive bodies which are less conductive. Furthermore, a study completed by Féménias (2008) of the Banifing shear zone highlighted that 
basement  rock  lineaments  are  well  resolved  in  the  magnetic  and  radiometric  airborne  geophysical 
datasets. A  limitation  to  interpreting  magnetic  data  is  the  fact  that  laterite-ferricrete  covers  a  significant 
portion of the study area and major parts of the Baoulé-Mossi domain (Brown et al., 1994; Blot, 2004; 
Beauvais  et  al.,  2008). The  presence  of  laterite-ferricrete  can  complicate  the  magnetic  data

Regional scale geophysical studies have been conducted in Burkina Faso by Mickus (2008) and 
Metelka et al. (2010) and in the Gawler craton in Australia by Stewart and Betts (2010). A large scale 
study  was  the  gravimetric  analysis  conducted  in  Burkina  Faso  by  Mickus  (2008). The  goal  was  to 
control the relation between the gravimetric anomalies and metal deposits throughout Burkina Faso. This study highlighted the use of the geophysical datasets on a large scale and the use of geological 
data in direct modelling even in the absence of geological data. The studies of Metelka et al.","llm,rules",PLACE

The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed 
sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic 
rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé 
basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts 
(Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni 
basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of 
siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al., 
1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and 
quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || 4. Electromagnetic data were acquired by SAGAX Afrique specifically for use in the project. The data 
was  collected  as  part  of  the  SYSMIN  project,  with  surveys  conducted  in  2002  by  the  FUGRO 
Airborne Survey Pty  Ltd. The  electromagnetic (EM)  data  available  covers only  two portions of  the 
study area:  the Yanfolila volcano-sedimentary belt and the Syama belt (Figure 2.1). 5. Geological data was taken from public domain company technical reports, research work, and the 
SYSMIN project. || Syama belt at Syama can be divided into sedimentary sequences of the Tarkwa Group in the east, and 
volcano-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  to  the  west  (Girard  et  al.,  1998). The  NNE 
trending Syama Shear Zone crosscuts the Syama belt (Standing, 2006). The structures that predominate in the study area include first-order scale crustal shear zones, and 
second-order shears, faults and folds. The Siguiri basin is dominated by north to NNE trending dextral 
strike-slip shear zones (Steyn, 2012), and a second order scale WNW trending faults. The Yanfolila 
belt is dominated by the northerly trending Yanfolila Shear Zone (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Randgold, 
2008; Miller et al., 2013). The eastern margin of the Bougouni basin is bounded by the Banifing Shear 
Zone. || The northwest trending Bagoe volcano-sedimentary belt is the western extension of 
the Bondiali-Bagoé-Diaoula belt in Ivory Coast which splits to form the Bagoé volcano-sedimentary

19 || This was established 
by Wijns (2009) in a comparative study between the magnetic and electromagnetic methods as used in 
the Syama belt. His work showed that intrusive bodies, which are indistinct in the magnetic data, are 
readily resolved from electromagnetic data. The host rocks in the Syama belt are highly conductive 
because of graphite in the host rocks, relative to the intrusive bodies which are less conductive. Furthermore, a study completed by Féménias (2008) of the Banifing shear zone highlighted that 
basement  rock  lineaments  are  well  resolved  in  the  magnetic  and  radiometric  airborne  geophysical 
datasets. A  limitation  to  interpreting  magnetic  data  is  the  fact  that  laterite-ferricrete  covers  a  significant 
portion of the study area and major parts of the Baoulé-Mossi domain (Brown et al., 1994; Blot, 2004; 
Beauvais  et  al.,  2008). The  presence  of  laterite-ferricrete  can  complicate  the  magnetic  data 
presentation  and  affect  interpretations,  but  by  applying  linear  filters  the  effects  of  laterite-ferricrete 
can be minimised in the magnetic signature.",llm,GEOLOGICAL_UNIT

The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed 
sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic 
rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé 
basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts 
(Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni 
basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of 
siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al., 
1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and 
quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || In Guinea it included geological maps of the Sirakoro (Egal et al., 1999a; Costea et 
al.,  1999),  Siguiri  (Egal  et  al.,  1999b),  Kankan  (Feybesse  et  al.,  1999),  Falama  (Lahondère  et  al., 
1999a;  Iliescu  et  al.,  1999)  and  Faraba  sheets  (Lahondère  et  al.,  1999b)  (Figure  1.3). There  are  no 
geology technical reports available at the regional scale for Guinea. In Mali, maps include the Kadiolo 
or  Niellé  (Kusnir  et  al.,  1986)  Massigui  (Claessens  et  al.,  1988)  and  Kadiana  or  Tingrela  sheets 
(Kusnir  et  al.,  1989),  and  additionally  the  Yanfolila,  Tienko,  Bougouni,  Massigui,  Tingréla,  Nielle, 
Bamako East and Bamako West sheets of Feybesse et al. (2006) (Figure 1.3) The reports include the 
geological map of Mali by  Girard et al. (1998), the geophysical data interpretation of southern Mali 
by  Randgold  (2007,  2008),  a  technical  report  by  Parker  and  Wilkinson  (2011)  and  finally,  a
