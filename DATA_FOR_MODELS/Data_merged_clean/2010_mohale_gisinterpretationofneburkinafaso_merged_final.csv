Since no GIS work has been done on the greenstone belts, there is no confirmation of association of 
greenstone  belts  with  laterite  profiles  found  throughout  the  study  area. From  the  interpretation  it  was 
found  that  the  laterite  profiles  have  the  same  orientation  as  the  greenstone  belts  and  cover  most  of  the 
study  area  where  greenstone  belts  are  located. Studies  by  Hein,  (2008)  show  that  dykes  in  northern 
Burkina Faso have laterite skirts and from the interpretation done in this study most of the dolerite dykes

1.1 Preamble 
Most geological maps of Burkina Faso are outdated and due to high cost of aerial photography the maps 
have not been updated. There is massive investment in exploration in NE Burkina Faso and there are few 
geological maps that assist in targeting, with the latest being completed by Castaing in 2003. Therefore a 
GIS  interpretation  was  undertaken  to  create  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  for  the  area. GIS 
interpretation has become the most important modern tool for geological interpretation and a fundamental 
approach in grassroots exploration for the delineation of resource potential. It involves the breaking up of 
complex  data  planes  into  simpler  and  more  interpretable  forms  related  to  geological  features. Remote 
sensing analysis from GIS is used to extract drainage and topographic patterns, curvilinear features and 
stands of lithologically related vegetation (Drury, 1987). || Figure  4.3: The  Boromo–Goren  Greenstone  Belt  (BGGB)  of  Burkina  Faso,  together  with the  Bouroum

2.1 Stratigraphy 
The  lithostratigraphy  in  north-eastern  Burkina  Faso  is  defined  by  NE-trending  Birimian  meta-
volcaniclastic  greywacke  and  intercalated  meta-conglomerate,  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  1. 2). The 
Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower 
Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in 
origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated 
black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et 
al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists 
of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al., 
1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian 
sequences  were  metamorphosed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  and  were  intruded  by  numerous  calc-
alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are

volcaniclastic  greywacke  and  intercalated  meta-conglomerate,  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  1. 2). The 
Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower 
Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in 
origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated 
black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et 
al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists 
of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al., 
1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian

alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are

1) Lower Birimian which includes a volcano-sedimentary package with intercalated fluvial deltaic meta-
sediments is unconformably overlain by the: 
2) Upper Birimian which is a volcanic-volcanoclastic package. Further investigations on lithologies and structures completed by  Hein et al. 2004 at Sanmatenga 
district  indicate  that  the  deposition  of  the  volcanic,  metasedimentary  and  turbidic  rocks  in  the  Gorem 
segment  of  the  BGGB  is  in  three  conformable  successions:  a  lower  volcano-  sedimentary  succession, 
mafic-intermediate  volcanic  succession,  and an  upper  volcano-sedimentary  succession. The  successions 
indicate  interplay  of  marine-deltaic  sedimentary  processes  and  volcanic  activity. The  deposition  was 
interpreted to have occurred within a marginal marine setting adjacent to an emergent volcanic centre or 
island arc setting (Hein et al., 2004). The conformable nature (angular unconformity) of the successions: 
the 1) Lower Birimian and 2) Upper Birimian does not provide any case of separation into two formations 
in the Sanmatenga district described from previous studies by Attoh (1982) and Feybesse et al., (1990).",llm,PLACE

volcaniclastic  greywacke  and  intercalated  meta-conglomerate,  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  1. 2). The 
Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower 
Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in 
origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated 
black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et 
al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists 
of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al., 
1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian 
sequences  were  metamorphosed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  and  were  intruded  by  numerous  calc-
alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are 
collectively  termed  the  Eburnean  granitoids  (Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Naba  et  al.,  2004;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).",llm,APPROXIMATE

been documented in literature. Greenstone belts and laterite profiles 
Since no GIS work has been done on the greenstone belts, there is no confirmation of association of 
greenstone  belts  with  laterite  profiles  found  throughout  the  study  area. From  the  interpretation  it  was 
found  that  the  laterite  profiles  have  the  same  orientation  as  the  greenstone  belts  and  cover  most  of  the 
study  area  where  greenstone  belts  are  located. Studies  by  Hein,  (2008)  show  that  dykes  in  northern 
Burkina Faso have laterite skirts and from the interpretation done in this study most of the dolerite dykes 
interpreted  had  the  laterite  skirts. The  four  greenstone  belts  Goren,  Bouroum,  Oudalan-Gorouol,  and 
Yalogo  greenstone  belts  locations  were  defined. A  Goren  Greenstone  Belt  is  cut  by  a  series  of  NE 
trending joint sets and the SSZ.",llm,PLACE

The dykes are predominantly NW-trending and are inferred to be dolerite in composition. The dykes are 
not continuous and hard to trace. Sand dunes 
Two images (p194r050 and p195r050) from the false colour composite 742 were used to delineate sand 
dunes  (Fig. 4.4). On  the  image  they  are  light  green  since  they  occur  in  areas with  less  vegetation. The 
sand dunes only cover the northern part of Burkina Faso, they form part of the Sahara desert.",llm,APPROXIMATE

The study area for the project is north east Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso is a landlocked country located in 
western  Africa,  north  of  Ghana  (Fig  1.1). It  shares  borders  with  six  countries  namely  Benin  in  the 
southeast, Ivory Coast in the south west, Togo and Ghana in the south, Mali in the north and Niger in the 
east. It  has  an  area  of  274.200  km2  and  an  annual  population  growth  of  2.7%.The  capital  city  is 
Ouagadougou. The official language is French and regional languages include Dioula and Mooré. 11",llm,PLACE
