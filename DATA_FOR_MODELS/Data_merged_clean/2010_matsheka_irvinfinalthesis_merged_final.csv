The development of seismites is interpreted as a result of either a seismic activity. These correlate with 
the seismites recorded by Mazumder et al (2006) which are deformations that occurred in unconsolidated 
sediments mainly as a result of shock. Soft sediment deformation is represented by slump facies recorded 
on both the Helicopter pit and the drill cores. Slumping in interpreted to have succeeded the deposition of 
the sediments and these occur mainly in continental slopes, seismically active environments and prior to 
the  consolidation  of  sediments. The  slump  sequence  of  the  main  Sadiola  open  cast  can  therefore  be 
correlated  with  that  of  the  ancilliary  pits  defined  by  Matabane  (2008). They  can  also  be  interpreted  to

The Sadiola deposits share some similarities with the other gold deposits in the West African Craton. In 
the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are 
gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite-
pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold 
systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008) 
with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation. Two  styles  of

The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3

d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit

Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold

Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments 
which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism 
reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral

Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates. || CHAPTER 6: Conclusion 
•  The mineral assemblages of the Sadiola open cast are representative of greenschist metamorphic 
facies. •  Sadiola lithologies underwent at least two deformation events: one associated with the Tangaean 
event (D1) and the latter associated with the Eburnean orogeny (D2). •  The  quartz  veins  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  in  the  D1  event  during  a  NE-directed 
compression. •  Sadiola  lithologies  underwent  two  metamorphic  events:  regional  metamorphism  to  lower 
greenschist facies and contact metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies. •  Gold  mineralisation  is  associated  with  a  variety  of  alteration  system  with  pyrite-arsenopyrite 
mineral assemblage. •  Mineralisation  tends  to  occur  along  the  carbonate-greywacke  contact  which  is  from  the  inner 
contact aureole to the middle aureole. || Metamorphism at Sadiola reached hornblende-hornfels facies as a result of 
the emplacement of tonalite-granodiorite plutons and the tonalite dykes  (Hein and Tshibubudze,  2007a, 
b). 3.4 Gold Mineralisation 
Three  types  of  gold  mineralisation  have  been  recognised  in  the  West  African  Craton. These  are  pre-
orogenic,  syn-orogenic  and  late-orogenic  mineralisation. Mineralisation  is  related  to  regional  tectonic 
event (Milesi et al, 1992; Beziat et al., 2008). Pre-orogenic deposits are associated with early extensional 
zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991; 
Fouillac et al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). Syn-orogenic mineralisation is associated with mineralisation in 
disseminated  sulphides  in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rock  (Milési  et  al.,  1992). || Mineralisation  at  Sadiola  has  been  shown  to  have  a  temporal  and  a  spatial 
relationship to the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and tonalite dykes. Sadiola is located in close proximity to 
the  Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian  plutonic  system. Mineralisation  has  shown  to  be  as  a  result  of  the 
fluids and metamorphism associated with the intrusions (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Determining the 
paragenesis,  investigation  of  the  mineralogical,  microstructural  and  alteration  events  will  assist  in 
determining  gold  mineralisation,  and  is  considered  important  for  the  Sadiola  exploration  and  in-mine 
development. 1.2  Location and Physiography 
The  Sadiola  opencast  mine  is  located  within  the  Sadiola  village. The  village  is  situated  in  the  south-
western part of Mali at about 77km south of the regional capital, Kayes (Fig. || The alteration types recorded in the host rocks are potassic, silicification, dolomitisation, chlorite-biotite 
alteration,  calc-silicate  and  sulphidation. The  common  sulphide  minerals  are  pyrite,  arsenopyrite  and 
pyrrhotite  with minor  magnetite and sphalerite. The following paragenetic sequence is observed for the 
ore  mineralogy:  pyrite  –  chalcopyrite  -  (+  sphalerite)  –  arsenopyrite. Gold is  paragenetically  associated 
with pyrite and arsenopyrite. The rocks also show evidence of deformation through kinked biotite and the 
development  of stylolites. Two metamorphic events are recorded at Sadiola: regional metamorphism to 
greenschist facies and contact metamorphism to hornblende-hornfels facies. || intrusions. The mineralisation at Sadiola  is therefore interpreted to be as a result of metamorphism and 
deformation  brought  about  the  Sekokoto  pluton  emplacement  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny. Structural 
data  indicate  that  quartz  veins  formed  prior  to  the  development  of  the  S2  cleavage  systems. These  are 
therefore  interpreted  to  be  post-Tangaean  and  pre-Eburnean  and  are  associated  with  minor  pyrite-
arsenopyrite  mineralisation. Mineralisation  was  therefore  upgraded  by  pluton  emplacement  and  the  re-
activation  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  the  remobilisation  of  fluids  to  cause  brecciation  and 
skarnification of the carbonate unit. The fluids have moderate to high salinity as determined by Pan and

silicate, followed by the calcitic marble and pelite, which is locally dolomitised. || intrusions. The mineralisation at Sadiola  is therefore interpreted to be as a result of metamorphism and 
deformation  brought  about  the  Sekokoto  pluton  emplacement  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny. Structural 
data  indicate  that  quartz  veins  formed  prior  to  the  development  of  the  S2  cleavage  systems. These  are 
therefore  interpreted  to  be  post-Tangaean  and  pre-Eburnean  and  are  associated  with  minor  pyrite-
arsenopyrite  mineralisation. Mineralisation  was  therefore  upgraded  by  pluton  emplacement  and  the  re-
activation  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  the  remobilisation  of  fluids  to  cause  brecciation  and

greywacke,  alternating  greywacke-shale  units,  impure  carbonates  which  were  folded  and  contain 
limestone beds, siltstone, minor tuff and volcanoclastics units (Boshoff et al, 1998; Hanssen et al., 1998; 
Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). Jordaan et al. (1994) indicated that calcitic marbles occur in the Kofi 
Formation. The Sadiola goldfield consists of greywacke, siltstone, marble, carbonaceous to volcanoclastic 
greywacke  and  BIF  shale  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). The  goldfield  occurs  along  a  marble-
greywacke contact located east of the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (Hanssen et al., 1998). The greywacke units of the Sadiola goldfield are best developed to the west of the Sadiola Fracture Zone, 
while impure carbonates are best developed to the east. || 4.3 Structure 
Two  deformation  events  are  recorded  for  the  study  areas  in  the  Sadiola  deposit. These  are  interpreted 
from  equal  area  stereographic  projections  of  bedding  and  the  discontinuous,  parallel  cleavage  in  the 
metasedimentary  rocks. The  equal  area  stereographic  projections  of  bedding  from  the  Helicopter  Pit 
records  a  calculated  mean  bedding  of  336o/64oE  with  a  calculated  mean  for  the  west  high-wall  of 
350o/51oW. The  spread  of  the  data  around  the  primitive  circles  is  related  to  folding  about  a  NNW-
trending  fold  axes  (F1)  and  refolding  of  F1  about  the  ENE-ESE  trending  fold  axes  (F2). Bedding  is 
rotated against minor faults (Fig. 6). || Sadiola deposit is therefore classified as either an intrusion-related gold deposit or a thermal aureole gold 
deposit,  which  are  all  subclasses  of  orogenic  gold  deposits. Mineralisation  at  the  Sadiola  deposit  is 
spatially and temporally associated with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and tonalite dykes. The Sadiola 
Fracture  Zone  served  as  the  fluid  conduit  and  mineralisation  occurs  along  the  inner  to  middle  contact 
aureole. The ubiquitous occurrence of biotite marker in polished thin sections is interpreted as indicating 
biotite isograd and marks the division between rocks that have been completely recrystallised at Sadiola 
to rocks in which the primary bedding is still preserved. vi || The Sadiola Fracture Zone is interpreted to be a 
splay  of  the  Senegalo-Malian  Shear  Zone. Carbonate  units  are  the  main  host  to  the  Sadiola  deposit

The two deformation phases that are identified in the study areas of the Sadiola goldfield correlate with 
the  deformation  phases  interpreted  by  Hein  (2009)  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  in  Burkina  Faso, 
Tshibubudze  et  al.,  (2009)  in  the  Markoye  Shear  Zone  in  Burkina  Faso. The  first  deformation  is 
characterized  by  the  development  of  NNW-trending  folds  (F1). NNW  bedding  and  cleavage  (S1) 
orientation associated with D1 are recorded in the study area. This deformation is termed the Tangaean 
Event and formed during the NE-SW shortening period. Quartz veins formed during this event and their 
dominant trend is towards NNE-NE. The second deformation event is characterized by the development of ENE-ESE trending folds (F2) and 
NE-trending  cleavage  (S2). || 5.4 Comparison to Sadiola goldfield with the rest of the West African Gold deposits 
The Sadiola deposits share some similarities with the other gold deposits in the West African Craton. In 
the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are 
gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite-
pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold 
systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008) 
with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation. Two  styles  of 
mineralisation  observed  in  Burkina  Faso  are  quartz-vein  and  disseminated  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008). || CHAPTER 1: Introduction

The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3

government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit 
(Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001). || Late-orogenic  deposits  are 
characterised by disseminated gold-bearing arsenopyrite and Au-quartz lode and quartz-vein type. These 
are interpreted as the major type and host of gold in West Africa (Milési et al., 1991).Two metallogenic 
styles  have  been  observed  in  the  Sadiola  goldfield  by  Hein  and  Tshibubudze  (2007a,  b)  and  these  are 
placer gold in the palaeochannels and screes and gold occurring in stockwork veins and breccias. 15 || Liégeois  et  al. (1991) concluded  that  metamorphism was  syn-tectonic  based  on the orientation  of  sheet 
silicates  and  amphiboles. The  KKI  sediments  were  then  intruded  by  various  granitiod  plutons  which 
caused further metamorphism (Dioh et al., 2006). The four types of granitoids that intruded the sediments 
of  the  KKI  are  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids,  amphibole  bearing  granitoids,  pyroxene  and  K-bearing 
granitoids  and  the  peraluminous  biotite  bearing  units  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). In  the  Sadiola  goldfield,  two 
metamorphic  events  are  recorded:  regional  metamorphism 
to  greenschist  facies  and  contact 
metamorphism  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). Contact  metamorphism  is  defined  as  the 
metamorphism that  occurs  in  close proximity  to  intrusions  and has  formed  as a  result  of  heat  from  the 
intrusion (Blatt et al., 2006). || The Sadiola Fracture Zone is interpreted to be a 
splay  of  the  Senegalo-Malian  Shear  Zone. Carbonate  units  are  the  main  host  to  the  Sadiola  deposit

1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The 
Reguibat Rise and the Man terrains are composed of Archaean to Proterozoic rock formations (Potrel et 
al., 1998) with the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Man shield referred to as the Birimian sequence (Beziat 
et al., 2000). The Kêniêba and Kayes inliers are situated towards the western border of Senegal and Mali (Fig.","llm,rules",PLACE

The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3 
and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société 
d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit

Three  types  of  gold  mineralisation  have  been  recognised  in  the  West  African  Craton. These  are  pre-
orogenic,  syn-orogenic  and  late-orogenic  mineralisation. Mineralisation  is  related  to  regional  tectonic 
event (Milesi et al, 1992; Beziat et al., 2008). Pre-orogenic deposits are associated with early extensional 
zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991; 
Fouillac et al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). Syn-orogenic mineralisation is associated with mineralisation in 
disseminated  sulphides  in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rock  (Milési  et  al.,  1992). || Abstract
