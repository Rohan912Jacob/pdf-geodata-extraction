normally  associated  with  significant  to  insignificant  production  of  ore,  poor  or  low-level  mining, 
processing and extraction practices, illegal trading and access (Cameroon, 2002), conflict, corruption, 
violence,  exploitation  and  human  rights  violations  (Bower,  1987;  ICMM,  2010),  poor  health 
(HIV/AIDS,  mental  health,  prostitution,  high  mortality  and  sanitation),  poor  safety  (high  worker

(Hoadley and Limpitlaw, 2004). ASM in Burkina Faso, where this study is located, extracts iron for 
the production of agricultural tools, and gold and silver in exchange for money and food. Hentschel et 
al. (2003)  divided  ASM  into  the  following  categories;  (a)  gold  rush  or  influx  (ICMM,  2010);  (b)

background to this study (a, b, e). Their information indicated that no artisanal mining for iron 
had taken place at Dem in their lifetimes. The senior elders ranged in age from 75-104 and they 
were  the  senior  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be 
reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. || Further to this, in Burkina Faso, the general outcrop distribution of ferricrete indicates that the 
surfaces have also been eroded, redeposited and cemented several times such that the current profile is 
representative of several phases of ferricrete formation (Middleton et al., 1997). In fact, ferricrete may 
overlie  one,  or  more  of  three  gently  inclined  laterite  pediments  that  formed  as  erosional  surfaces 
between 45 Ma and 2 Ma (Beauvais et al., 2008). 2.4. Iron ore deposits in the WAC 
The WAC hosts iron ore reserves that are hosted in large Palaeoproterozoic BIF (banded iron 
formation) deposits (>6000  mt) of iron ore in the Man and Reguibat shields (Bronner et al., 1990). The BIF in greenstone belts are also a local source of iron (Milési et al., 1989). BIF's  are  fine  bedded  chemical  sedimentary  rocks  composed  of  chert  (amorphous  silica)  and 
iron-bearing minerals with an iron content of greater than 30 wt% (USGS, 2000). || However, 
laterites derived from weathering of basic or ultra-basic rocks, or host rocks that are enriched in iron, 
such as iron-rich shales and siltstones, may be sufficiently rich in iron (and/or other elements such as 
nickel) to be minable. This is the case in the Dem study area, where iron-rich laterite overlies iron-rich 
shale host rocks of the Birimian Supergroup. In  contrast  to  laterite,  ferricrete  is  the  iron-cemented  duricrust  that  is  formed  by  various 
processes  particularly  pedogenesis  (McFarlane,  1976). Generally  it  overlies  the  laterite  profile  in 
Burkina  Faso  but  is  still  regarded  as  part  of  the  laterite  weathering  profile  (Schwartz,  1994). The 
mineralogy of ferricrete is typically composed of goethite, limonite, lepicrocite, hematite in varying 
proportions,  sometimes  with  minor  amounts  of  manganese  oxides,  and  residual  base  metal  sulfides 
(Craig  and  Vaughan,  1994). The  profile  typically  presents  indurated  strata  rich  in  kaolinite  and 
hematite (Nahon and Tardy, 1992). || Importantly, although the Museum of Kaya has a single ASM furnace on display to preserve 
the techniques  of  iron  forging,  the  museum  indicated  that  no  research has ever  been  undertaken  on 
iron  mining,  processing  and  production  anywhere  in  Burkina  Faso  and  certainly  not  in  the  Dem 
region. With this in mind, this study focuses on the historic mining, processing and production of iron 
ore in the Dem region of Burkina Faso. Because the history is arguably lost, the techniques are not 
known, the reasons for production are forgotten and the age of mine workings is no longer known, 
this  study  records  the  size  and  dimensions  of  the  mine  sites,  waste  sites,  orebody  and  furnaces. It 
records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the 
processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings 
in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and 
could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century. || Kribek,  B.,  Syrokorova,  I.,  Machovic,  V.,  Laufek,  F.,  2008. Graphitization  of  organic  matter  and

The Dem ASM site should be protected and conserved as a historic and cultural monument by 
the  relevant  authorities  in  Burkina  Faso  at  state  and  provincial  levels. The  protection  will  prevent 
degradation and destruction of the heritage and consequently will preserve the values and history of 
the  area  for  present  and  future  generations  of  Africa. The  Dem  region  is  important  to  a  fuller 
understanding of the history and society of the Songhai Empire  – it thus adds to the archaeological 
history of the African peoples. There may be a case to motivate for World Heritage Status but further 
research in the region is necessary. 70 || Some BIF deposits are formed from metal-rich brines that are expelled at active rift zones by 
hydrothermal  activity. This  is  case  for  the  Faléme  iron  ore  deposits  which  are  the  largest 
Palaeoproterozoic  iron  ore  deposits  in  the  WAC  (Combes,  1980;  Milési  et  al.,  1992). They  are 
spatially associated with hydrothermal mineralisation associated with tourmalinisation, carbonisation, 
chloritisation and albitisation of the host metasedimentary and volcanic rocks (Bassot, 1997). Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  Tin  Edia  deposit  of  the  Oudalan  province  in  Burkina  Faso 
(Neyberg  et  al.,  1980). The  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  veins  which  crosscut  gabbro,  gabbro-
norite  and  norite  intrusions  as  magnetite  and  ilmenite,  with  accessory  pyrrhotite,  pentlandite  and 
arsenopyrite  (Castaing  et  al.,  2003). Iron-titanium  ores  mostly  consist  of  titaniferous-magnetite  in 
association with ulvospinel and ilmenite. || The  tuyere  is  clearly  visible. A  goat  skin  bellows  would  have  been

medium-scale  mining  (ASM)  for  livelihoods. According  to  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso 
there have been no studies of ASM for iron in Burkina Faso, and there are no records of iron mining 
and processing for the Dem region. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known 
but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not 
been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly 
not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of 
Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the 
Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the 
Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through 
the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon 
people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion 
et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the 
Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths, 
or before 1920-1930 AD. || The process of 
finding  adequate  markets  for  minerals  in  the  ASM  sector  is  also  difficult  and  may  be  disorganized 
(United Nations, 2002) and trade tends to follow along traditional or informal trade routes, or occurs 
within the same country. ASM sites are also associated with health, safety and environmental problems. Lovitz (2006) 
stated that poor health and safety, and the use of environmentally destructive mining and processing 
practices  draw  criticism  to  the  sector. The  health,  safety  and  environmental  problems  are  often 
aggravated  by  inadequate  regulatory  frameworks  governing  ASM  in  many  developing  countries, 
especially in Africa. Nonetheless, although ASM may be associated with negative impacts, it provides 
a  means  of  livelihood, jobs  and  business  opportunities  to  millions  of  people  across  the  world. This 
includes ASM in Burkina Faso both in a modern and historic context. || cit.). Gold mining has recently become 
an  important  economic  aspect  of  development  in  Burkina  Faso,  with  gold  producing  mines  in  the 
northeast  and  southwest  at  Essakane  gold  mining  (Tshibubudze  and  Hein,  2013)  and  Mana  gold

Burkina Faso lies on the West African Craton (WAC). Burkina Faso is generally characterized 
by  granitic  gneiss,  and  also  north to  northeast-trending  belts  of  metasedimentary  and  meta-volcanic 
rocks  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  (ca. 2.3  Ga)  that  are  intruded  by  trondjemite-
tonalite-granodiorite plutons (ca. || shrub  vegetation,  or  acacia  forest. The  country  has  a  subtropical  Sahelian  climate  with  two  distinct 
seasons, i.e., rainy season and dry season. The  dry  season  lasts  for  eight  to  nine  months  with  a  rainy  season  from  June  to  September 
(Bierschenk, 1968). Burkina Faso is characterised by low hills and alluvial plains, and is covered by 
an extensive laterite plateau which is locally mined as a source for iron ore, or for alluvial gold. Land use can be divided into (1) land that includes pastures, woodland, forest, built-up areas, 
barren lands and roads, and which total 82% of all land in Burkina Faso; (2) arable land that is mainly 
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (e.g., rice, maize, wheat) and which only total 
17% of all land; and (3) permanent cultivated land that cannot be replanted after harvest (e.g. coffee, 
rubber) and which makes up 1% of all land (Bierschenk, op. || tradition of significant elders of the Mossi people. The Dem site is thus an archaeological curiosity

background to this study (a, b, e). Their information indicated that no artisanal mining for iron 
had taken place at Dem in their lifetimes. The senior elders ranged in age from 75-104 and they 
were  the  senior  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be 
reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years.","llm,rules",PLACE

ASM  site  which  today  hosts  2  dams  for  irrigation  and  extensive  market  gardens  (Figure  3.1). The 
vegetation at the valley is presently dominated by large trees and savannah forest. It seems possible 
that the historic Dem forest could  have provided the source of fuel (charcoal) during iron smelting, 
and perhaps a ready source of water. A source of flux is also important in iron ore production. Flux is used as a reducing agent that 
facilitates  the  chemical  reaction  and  separates  the  molten  metal  from  the  waste  (slag)  in  smelting. Some fluxes used in smelting include carbonate and quartz. || Chapter  Three  presents  the  Methodology  used  in  this  research;  it  also  describes  in  detail  the 
different  techniques  used  for  data  acquisition,  data  analysis,  interpretation  and  the  final  product  of 
every  stage. Some  of  the  methods  included  GIS  evaluation,  petrography,  ore  petrology  and  dating. GIS evaluation involved the use CorelDraw® and GoogleEarth® for data processing and interpretation. This helped establish the location of mine sites, furnaces, artefacts, river profiles and contacts. Chapter Four describes the Mine Site at Dem, its mining footprint and the layout of the mine 
sites, processing sites, mines, and waste dumps. 20 || In the study area a considerable amount of 
crushed  quartz  and  outcrops  of  quartz  veins  occurs  both  in  the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also 
regionally. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are 
carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. It is possible that quartz 
was the main flux, but further study is needed to clarify this aspect of iron ore production at Dem. An important aspect of the greater mining footprint of the Dem ASM site are the many tracks, 
which stand proud in the eroding fossil aeolian landscape. Tracks in desert aeolian sands are difficult 
to  eradicate  and  can  remain  for  decades  as  trace  fossils  as  evidenced  from  rehabilitation  programs 
around  the  world  which  want to  remove  tire and track  damage  in  deserts  (Burke  and  Cloete,  2004; 
Wassenaar et al., 2013). In the Dem study area, tracks are pressed into the fossil alluvial soil (that is 
currently being eroded) and these lead from mine to furnaces and processing sites, and from the east 
of  the  mine  site  region  where  the  historic  Dem  forest  is  speculated  to  have  been  situated,  to  the 
furnaces. || Interstitial  areas  are 
filled  with  oxide  minerals  that  make  up  the  matrix  producing  an  iron  rich  quartz  breccia. The  iron 
oxides are dominated by hematite and/or magnetite that are replaced by spinel. Patches and veins of 
oxidised iron form part of the thin-section. 5.4. Slag geology and petrology 
Slag is found at several furnace sites at Dem. The slag contains primary slag phases including 
oxides, silicates, sulphides and the metal phase. || The 
furnace materials included charcoal on fragments of broken furnace bricks and samples of slag. All  samples  were  transported  to  the  University  of  the  Witwatersrand  Johannesburg  for 
laboratory work. At the university, the lithology samples were catalogued and sent to the School of 
Geosciences thin-section laboratory for preparation, while metallurgical and ore body samples were 
sent  to  the  SGS  Laboratory  in  Booysens  for  polished  block  preparation. Carbon  samples  were 
packaged and shipped to the Beta Analytic laboratory in Miami, Florida, USA. 3.4. Petrography 
A total of 59 samples were collected (Appendix 3) from sites of interest at Dem including host 
rocks,  ore  bearing  rocks  and  slag  and  petrographic  sections  were  made. || The  dominant  mineral  phases  in  the  shale  and  siltstone  that  are  the  host  rocks  to  iron  ore  at 
Dem  are  unsurprisingly  quartz,  mica  and  carbonate,  with  accessory  feldspar,  graphite  and  rarely 
magnetite. Petrographically the ore bearing rocks consist of goethite-hematite as the dominant oxides 
with silica. 68 || The  slower  cooled  slag  exhibits  phaneritic 
texture with crystals that are large in size (c.f., Craddock and Meeks, 1987; van Oss, 2002). The fast 
cooling rate exhibits an aphanitic texture wherein the slag will have small crystals with vesicles. The 
rapid  cooling  rate  produced  a  granular  or  glassy  texture  with  very  fine  crystals  that  resemble  the 
volcanic rock obsidian (c.f., van Oss, 2002; Stewart, 2007). Ethnographic research indicated that ASM of iron ore from the Dem site did not take place in 
the  last  80  years  or  1932-2012. Additionally,  the  Museum  of  Kaya  and  the  National  Museum  of 
Burkina  Faso  does  not record iron  workings  at  Dem  over  the  last  hundred  years. There  are  also  no 
other historic records of iron making at Dem. || The ore might have been man-hauled to 
the surface in bags or sacks particularly because there is no evidence at the Dem site of mechanical 
aids for hoisting and hauling ore. It is possible that the open cast operations were mined by women, 
children  and  aged  persons,  as  can  be  witnessed  at  ASM  sites  throughout  Burkina  Faso  and  West 
Africa, with the underground operations being the domain of men. Different  types  of  slag  were  dumped  proximal  to  the  furnace  sites  and  included  (1)  a  dense 
black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy type resembling an 
obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a spinifex-like texture 
due  to  quenching  at  high  temperature,  and  (4)  a  clay  containing  pumice-like  slag  with  vugs  that 
formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. A considerable amount of clean crushed quartz and outcrops of quartz veins occurs both in the 
mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally,  which  may  have  been  used  as  a  flux  in  the  smelting 
process. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are 
carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. At Dem, an immediate source of charcoal could have been from the valleys to the east of the 
ASM site which today hosts dams for irrigation and extensive market gardens. || resources (iron ore, charcoal, clay, water and flux), (2) the choice of trees for making charcoal and 
transporting them to the processing site, (3) clay collection for furnace construction and production of 
tuyere  and  crucibles,  and  (4)  distribution  of  the  final  product  after  smelting. Presumably,  historic 
smelters  could  possibly  choose  the  smelting  site  near  at  least  one  resource. Certainly,  the  iron-rich 
resources  at  Dem  gave  reason  for  the  other  industries  to  exist;  tuyere,  crucible  and  furnace  brick 
production is interpreted to have taken place locally from orange aeolian sand which covers the Dem 
study area. Charcoal was the most appropriate fuel for the smelting of iron ore in ancient times but the type 
of  wood  used  in  the  Dem  study  area  is  a  subject  of  speculation. Charcoal  is  a  by-product  of  dry 
distillation  of  wood  and  contains  high  carbon  content  (Karbowniczek,  2005). It  is  advantageous

must also have been economically  viable because a considerable amount of human capital and skill 
was expended at the site. Ore dressing and processing extended over a considerable area of the study 
site. 4.5. The greater mining footprint 
The  Dem  ASM  site  is  located  2km  west  of  the  Dem  village,  which  is  situated  at  latitude 
13°11'17.528"" and longitude 1°10'43.199""W. According to Haaland et al. || In the study area a considerable amount of 
crushed  quartz  and  outcrops  of  quartz  veins  occurs  both  in  the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also 
regionally. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are 
carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. It is possible that quartz 
was the main flux, but further study is needed to clarify this aspect of iron ore production at Dem. An important aspect of the greater mining footprint of the Dem ASM site are the many tracks, 
which stand proud in the eroding fossil aeolian landscape. Tracks in desert aeolian sands are difficult 
to  eradicate  and  can  remain  for  decades  as  trace  fossils  as  evidenced  from  rehabilitation  programs 
around  the  world  which  want to  remove  tire and track  damage  in  deserts  (Burke  and  Cloete,  2004; 
Wassenaar et al., 2013). In the Dem study area, tracks are pressed into the fossil alluvial soil (that is 
currently being eroded) and these lead from mine to furnaces and processing sites, and from the east 
of  the  mine  site  region  where  the  historic  Dem  forest  is  speculated  to  have  been  situated,  to  the 
furnaces. || RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Dem ASM site should be protected and conserved as a historic and cultural monument by 
the  relevant  authorities  in  Burkina  Faso  at  state  and  provincial  levels. The  protection  will  prevent 
degradation and destruction of the heritage and consequently will preserve the values and history of 
the  area  for  present  and  future  generations  of  Africa. The  Dem  region  is  important  to  a  fuller 
understanding of the history and society of the Songhai Empire  – it thus adds to the archaeological 
history of the African peoples. There may be a case to motivate for World Heritage Status but further

for mining at the Dem site. Processing  sites  comprised  at  least  11  furnaces  that  were  dome  and  circular  in  shape. The

influenced  by  the  cooling  rate,  temperature  and  the  chemical  composition  of  the  iron  ore,  flux, 
charcoal and clay. Higher temperatures decrease the viscosity of the melt. Different  types  of  slag  (Figure  4.7)  were  dumped  at  different  locations  in  the  Dem  area  and

iron  mining,  processing  and  production  anywhere  in  Burkina  Faso  and  certainly  not  in  the  Dem 
region. With this in mind, this study focuses on the historic mining, processing and production of iron 
ore in the Dem region of Burkina Faso. Because the history is arguably lost, the techniques are not 
known, the reasons for production are forgotten and the age of mine workings is no longer known, 
this  study  records  the  size  and  dimensions  of  the  mine  sites,  waste  sites,  orebody  and  furnaces. It 
records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the 
processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings 
in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and 
could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century. || Interviews  were  conducted  with  community  members  of  the  towns  of  Liligomde  and  Kaya, 
which are the two local centres of artisanal mining for iron and gold. No interviews were held without 
the  expressed  permission  of  the  senior  elders  of  the  villages. Data  was  recorded  in  a  notebook; 
translations  from  Mossi  to  French  and  English  where  facilitated  by  Mr  Bamogo  Makido  of  the 
Museum of Kaya and all notes were recorded in English. Several consultations were specifically conducted with two groups of senior elders (ages ranged 
from 75 to 101 years of age) of the village of Liligomde near Kaya (Figure 1.3), who were the former 
chief  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. The  results  of  the  consultations  clearly 
argued that mining of iron in the Dem region, or any significant artisanal mining in the Dem region 
for any metal commodity, had not occurred in the last 80-90 years, i.e., mining in the Dem region is 
not recorded in oral tradition of the significant elders of the Mossi people. In fact, the consultations 
recorded that mining for iron for primarily agricultural purposes only took place at a site immediately 
west of the village of Liligomde and not at Dem. || Metallic  iron  was  used for  decorative  purposes  and  weapons in  prehistoric 
times  (Bahn  et  al.,  1994). The  most  primitive  sample  is  a  cluster  of  oxidized  iron  beads  found  in 
Egypt that date from 4000 BC. Historically, there was virtually no use of metals in sub-Saharan Africa before 500 BC, when 
both iron and copper came into use in the savannah and forest regions of West Africa (Smith et al., 
1993). Large amounts of iron were smelted in the Nile Valley. Iron reached eastern Africa by 200 BC, 
and by 200 AD had been carried to the south by ancestors of the modern Bantu peoples, together with 
farming. However, the age of iron in the Dem region is not known and establishing its age may be 
important to the mining history and heritage of the African continent. || Project aims

place. The sampling of furnaces was undertaken as a pilot study in 2011, with a view to a focussed 
comprehensive  study  if  the  pilot  study  was  successful,  but  limited  funding  has  meant  that  a 
comprehensive study has not been possible to date. There  are  three  primary  carbon  isotopes  that  are  12C,  13C  and  14C. 14C  is  radioactive  whereas 
isotopes 12C and 13C are stable (Vogel et al., 1993). || The  tuyere  is  clearly  visible. A  goat  skin  bellows  would  have  been 
placed over the bellows hole to pump air into the tuyere. This particular working forge is on exhibition at the 
Museum of Kaya and is presented with the permission of the Museum. The Dem region is situated 17 km north-northwest of the town of Kaya in Burkina Faso (Figure 
1.2). Burkina  Faso’s  rural  economy  is  dependent  on  agriculture,  and  seasonal  artisanal  small  and 
medium-scale  mining  (ASM)  for  livelihoods. According  to  the  National  Museum  of  Burkina  Faso

the techniques  of  iron  forging,  the  museum  indicated  that  no  research has ever  been  undertaken  on 
iron  mining,  processing  and  production  anywhere  in  Burkina  Faso  and  certainly  not  in  the  Dem

ore in the Dem region of Burkina Faso. Because the history is arguably lost, the techniques are not 
known, the reasons for production are forgotten and the age of mine workings is no longer known, 
this  study  records  the  size  and  dimensions  of  the  mine  sites,  waste  sites,  orebody  and  furnaces. It 
records the techniques used as best can be interpreted from the site. It looks at the metallurgy of the 
processed ore, and type of the ore deposit. Oral tradition has suggested that the age of iron workings 
in the Dem region may predate the time of the Mogho Naabas (i.e., Kings of the Mossi people) and 
could thus be as old as the foundation of the Mossi Empire, whose inception was in the 15th century.",llm,GEOLOGICAL_UNIT

important being metalwork, mechanics and carpentry; the regional economy was dependant on gold

of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be  reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. Artisanal mining for iron is conducted west of the village of Liligomde (c) with smelting in the village on small

expansion  of  iron  technology  from  1400-1600  AD  in  West  Africa  (Todd,  1979). They  correspond 
with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the 
first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages 
of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for 
in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period 
1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant 
centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated 
in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao. These  towns  are  respectively  situated  360  km  west,  450  km  north-
northwest and 370 km northeast of Dem across the international border of present day Burkina Faso 
and Mali. || Iron production at the Dem site was Bloomery furnace smelting, where a fluid state of iron was 
produced. The quality of ore produced is not known as there is no iron metal artefact discovered but 
could  have  ranged  from  soft  iron  to  steel. This  suggests  that  a  good  level  of  smelting  knowledge 
existed at the time. However, due to the variation of magnetite and hematite content the samples studied, it can be 
argued that smelting practices were variable from one furnace to another. Furnaces 1, 3, 4 and 5 were 
more  efficient  than  furnaces  9,  10,  due  to  the  amount  of  Fe-oxide  in  the  slag  and  the  physical 
appearance  of  the  slag. Iron  smelting  took  place  at  different  cooling  rates  and  encompassed  slow 
cooling  rate,  fast  cooling  rate  and  rapid  cooling  rate. || It can thus be reasonably interpreted that the Dem site predates modern iron making in the Kaya 
region. Radiocarbon  dates  given  for  the  last  80  years  were  thus  discounted. The  age  of  mining, 
processing and production is thus tentatively constrained by radiocarbon dating to have been active in 
1438-1458 AD, 1600-1651 AD, or 1756-1759 AD. Iron was initially forged in West Africa as early as the 6th century (Insoll, 1997; Pleiner, 2000) 
and iron smelting was practiced in the southeast of Burkina Faso by the Bura  culture whose culture 
was focused in the region 250 km southeast of Dem. Iron forging and smelting was thus known to the 
peoples of West Africa. By the 15th century, forging and smelting of iron (and gold) where central to 
the region and particularly, the Songhay economy which dominated trade in the region. || Lac  Dem  is  located  east  of  the  town  of 
Dem. Figure 3.2: Geology and layout of the Dem site. Open cast mines 1-3 are located on the eastern side 
of  a  ridge  of  ferricrete  duricrust  and  immediately  east  of  ferricrete  scree  in  Fe-Mn  rich

dumps are situated proximal to the furnace sites. Figure 4.1: Photographs of vein-hosted iron ore from adits in the underground mines of the Dem iron 
site. || The  slower  cooled  slag  exhibits  phaneritic 
texture with crystals that are large in size (c.f., Craddock and Meeks, 1987; van Oss, 2002). The fast 
cooling rate exhibits an aphanitic texture wherein the slag will have small crystals with vesicles. The 
rapid  cooling  rate  produced  a  granular  or  glassy  texture  with  very  fine  crystals  that  resemble  the 
volcanic rock obsidian (c.f., van Oss, 2002; Stewart, 2007). Ethnographic research indicated that ASM of iron ore from the Dem site did not take place in 
the  last  80  years  or  1932-2012. Additionally,  the  Museum  of  Kaya  and  the  National  Museum  of 
Burkina  Faso  does  not record iron  workings  at  Dem  over  the  last  hundred  years. There  are  also  no 
other historic records of iron making at Dem. || The  volcano-sedimentary  formation  in  the  northeast  portion  of  the  WAC  contains  stratiform 
deposits  of  iron-rich  shale,  manganese  and  manganese-iron-carbonate  deposits  particularly  in  the 
northeast  of  Burkina  Faso  at  Tambão  (Kimberly,  1989;  Beauvais  et  al.,  2008)  and  Billiata 
(Tshibubudze and Hein, 2013). Manganiferous iron ore deposits are formed by the leaching of silica, 
carbon dioxide, magnesia and minor amounts of other constituents. In addition, some manganiferous 
deposits  are  formed  by  the  local  migration  of  iron  and  manganese  that  produced  space  filling  and 
replacement  of  silica. Manganese  iron  ore  deposits  are  formed  on  the  seafloor  and  build-up  as 
chemical sediments together with additional sedimentary or volcanic detritus (Dasgupta et al., 1999; 
Mücke, 2005 suggesting that perhaps the formation of the iron and manganese deposits is related to 
seafloor exhalite processes. In  the  Goren  greenstone  belt,  in  which  the  Dem  site  is  located,  Fe-rich  siltstone  shale  and 
siltstone  are  sometimes  manganiferous  and  intercalated  with  volcaniclastic  meta-greywacke,  meta-
siltstone with minor resedimented pyroclastic deposits (Peters and Hein, 2013). However, repetitious 
successions  of  Fe-rich  low  grade  metamorphosed  siltstones,  fine-grained,  carbonaceous,  Fe-rich 
exhalative and volcaniclastic units are typically intercalated with the basalt units. || The ore might have been man-hauled to 
the surface in bags or sacks particularly because there is no evidence at the Dem site of mechanical 
aids for hoisting and hauling ore. It is possible that the open cast operations were mined by women, 
children  and  aged  persons,  as  can  be  witnessed  at  ASM  sites  throughout  Burkina  Faso  and  West 
Africa, with the underground operations being the domain of men. Different  types  of  slag  were  dumped  proximal  to  the  furnace  sites  and  included  (1)  a  dense 
black-grey flowing type that resulted from a slow cooling rate, (2) a black glassy type resembling an 
obsidian formed as result of a rapid cooling rate in the presence of water, (3) a spinifex-like texture 
due  to  quenching  at  high  temperature,  and  (4)  a  clay  containing  pumice-like  slag  with  vugs  that 
formed due to the release of gas bubbles in the melt. A considerable amount of clean crushed quartz and outcrops of quartz veins occurs both in the 
mine  sites  themselves,  but  also  regionally,  which  may  have  been  used  as  a  flux  in  the  smelting 
process. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are 
carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. At Dem, an immediate source of charcoal could have been from the valleys to the east of the 
ASM site which today hosts dams for irrigation and extensive market gardens. || The ore was dominantly composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) and hematite (Fe2O3), with impurities of 
SiO2,  as  occurs  in  many  ancient  iron  and  copper  sites  that  produce  an  iron  silicate  slag  of  low 
temperature  (1200°C)  slag  (Craddock  and  Meeks,  1987). The  magnetite-hematite  rich  veins  were 
structurally controlled in the host rocks. Lateritic ore also provided a second source of iron-rich rock 
for mining at the Dem site. Processing  sites  comprised  at  least  11  furnaces  that  were  dome  and  circular  in  shape. The 
furnaces were filled with crucibles and tuyeres made of clay sand perhaps sourced  locally from the 
alluvial plain  on  which  the  furnaces are  situated  or the  Dem  Valley  which is  now  occupied  by  Lac 
Dem (Figures 3.1; 3.2). Crucibles and tuyeres litter the furnace sites as waste or are welded together 
with  slag  in  the  base  of  the  furnace  structure. || The waste rock in the mine sites was dumped near the open casts and underground mines. Open casts 
tend to produce more waste than underground mines where a minimal quantity of waste was removed 
to gain access to the ore deposit (Hudson et al., 1999). It is thus that the largest waste piles are located 
next to the opencast mines. Waste  from  the  furnaces  included  slag  and  furnace  fragments  which  were  dumped  after 
smelting and within metres of the furnaces (Figure 4.6). Processing sites were also located proximal to 
the furnace sites. Figure 4.6: Processing sites at the Dem site. || Waste  areas  are  situated  adjacent  to  most  furnaces 
suggesting a modest level of industrial activity ranging from mining or ore, processing and cleaning, 
building  of  furnaces,  making  of  crucibles  and  tuyeres,  and  processing  the  slag  after  smelting. The 
presence of at least 11 furnaces with significant mining and processing of ore  suggests that the Dem 
site may have been an important historic iron producing region. A source of fuel remains speculative but the location of the mine site adjacent to the Lac Dem, 
which  historically  was  a  wooden  valley  prior  to  the  damming  of  the  lake,  may  have  meant  that  a 
source of fuel in the form of timber was readily available. In any case, timber for charcoal may have 
been  transported  to  the  site  in  the  same  way  that  timber  for  charcoal  is  transported  to  the  growing 
urban centres nearby from the forest surrounding the region (Kramer, 2002; Ouedraogo et al., 2010). A source of flux may have the carbonaceous rocks and quartz that form part of the host rocks of 
the region, or waste rock to the iron ore. A source of clean limestone which would make an ideal flux 
does not occur in the region according to regional maps of Hottin and Ouedraogo (1992), Hein et al. || no  involvement  with nearby  communities;  (d)  seasonal  ASM  activities  within  an  agricultural  cycle; 
and  (e)  traditional  year-around  activities  that  are  generally  associated  with  stable  communities  (or 
‘permanent  cohabitation’  of  ICMM,  2010). ASM  is  ultimately  maintained  by  the  demand  for  a 
commodity in question (e.g., gold, tantalum, iron, diamonds and sand). ASM of iron in the Sahelian-Saharan rural sector is often characterised by one man with one 
small furnace, one pump and one crucible (Figure 1.1 and Frontispiece), although increasingly ASM 
of  iron  recycles  steel. However,  the  Dem  site  which  covers  an  area  in  access  of  2  km2  presents  a 
significant  scale  of  mining,  with  11  large  furnaces  and  hundreds  of  crucibles,  and  a  large  mining 
footprint. Importantly, the site is not modern as evidenced by small grassed fossil dunes of sand which 
cover forging sites and are presently undergoing erosion to expose aspects of the mining area. Figure  1.1:  Photograph  of  a  typical  modern  day  artisanal  forge  that  is  operated  by  one  man,  with  a  single

33 || 4. THE MINE SITE AT DEM 
4.1. Introduction 
The  mining  of  iron  ore  in  the  Dem  study  area  produced  a  limited  number  of  underground 
workings and surface open pits. These mine workings show no modern mechanised mining method of 
operating. The  surveyed  ASM  site  covers  1.9  km  by  1.3  km. About  four  ore  extraction  areas  and 
eleven  smelting  sites  were  located  during  field  studies  but  a  broader  study  of  the  Dem  region  is 
warranted. || All of these are the sources of errors that need to be taken into consideration when 
analysing and interpreting the 14C ages. Accelerator  Mass  Spectrometry  (AMS)  radiocarbon  dating  is  a  technique  that  is  based  on 
detecting and counting the amount of beta radiation emitted in a unit time by radiocarbon atoms in a 
sample of known weight (Guo et al., 2000). This technique usually provides reliable results and is also 
based  on  counting  the  relative  amount  of  radiocarbon  to  stable  carbon  isotopes  in  a  sample  with  a 
mass spectrometer (Oda et al., 2000). The technique requires very small samples (usually below one 
gram in weight) and the time necessary to measure the amount of radiocarbon in each sample is only a 
few minutes. For  pilot  AMS  radiocarbon  dating,  six  samples  with  a  wide  range  of  carbon  content  were 
selected  from  different  furnace  sites  in  the  Dem  study  area  including  samples  FOR02-01CAR, 
FOR05-02CAR,  FOR06-02CAR,  FOR08-01CAR,  FOR09-01CAR,  and  FOR11-01CAR. The 
characteristics of the selected samples are presented in Table 3.1. || However, 
laterites derived from weathering of basic or ultra-basic rocks, or host rocks that are enriched in iron, 
such as iron-rich shales and siltstones, may be sufficiently rich in iron (and/or other elements such as 
nickel) to be minable. This is the case in the Dem study area, where iron-rich laterite overlies iron-rich 
shale host rocks of the Birimian Supergroup. In  contrast  to  laterite,  ferricrete  is  the  iron-cemented  duricrust  that  is  formed  by  various 
processes  particularly  pedogenesis  (McFarlane,  1976). Generally  it  overlies  the  laterite  profile  in 
Burkina  Faso  but  is  still  regarded  as  part  of  the  laterite  weathering  profile  (Schwartz,  1994). The 
mineralogy of ferricrete is typically composed of goethite, limonite, lepicrocite, hematite in varying 
proportions,  sometimes  with  minor  amounts  of  manganese  oxides,  and  residual  base  metal  sulfides 
(Craig  and  Vaughan,  1994). The  profile  typically  presents  indurated  strata  rich  in  kaolinite  and 
hematite (Nahon and Tardy, 1992). || In the study area a considerable amount of 
crushed  quartz  and  outcrops  of  quartz  veins  occurs  both  in  the  mine  sites  themselves,  but  also 
regionally. A  ready  source  of  clean  carbonate  does  not  exist  although  many  of  the  siltstones  are 
carbonaceous in composition and may have acted as a flux during smelting. It is possible that quartz 
was the main flux, but further study is needed to clarify this aspect of iron ore production at Dem. An important aspect of the greater mining footprint of the Dem ASM site are the many tracks, 
which stand proud in the eroding fossil aeolian landscape. Tracks in desert aeolian sands are difficult 
to  eradicate  and  can  remain  for  decades  as  trace  fossils  as  evidenced  from  rehabilitation  programs 
around  the  world  which  want to  remove  tire and track  damage  in  deserts  (Burke  and  Cloete,  2004; 
Wassenaar et al., 2013). In the Dem study area, tracks are pressed into the fossil alluvial soil (that is 
currently being eroded) and these lead from mine to furnaces and processing sites, and from the east 
of  the  mine  site  region  where  the  historic  Dem  forest  is  speculated  to  have  been  situated,  to  the 
furnaces. || Slag was dumped near the smelting sites (furnaces) and also close to 
the ore sources. The layout of the Dem ASM site is presented in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The  host  rocks  to  the  iron  ore  deposits  included  metamorphosed  shale,  siltstone,  low  grade 
laterite-ferricrete  and  mineralised  quartz  cataclasite  veins. At least  one  mine  site,  the  host  rock  was 
mangacrete. 4.2. Ore body 
The Dem study area is situated in the Goren greenstone belt and hosted in rocks of the Birimian 
Supergroup (Hein et al., 2004; Hein 2010). || The  Dem  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  (GGB)  which  comprises  meta-
volcanic  and  pyroclastic  units  that  are  interbedded  with  meta-sedimentary  rocks  (Hein  et  al.,  2004; 
2010). Carbonaceous  manganese-rich  shale  beds  and  tholeiitic  dacitic  rocks  are  interbedded  with 
volcanic units (Kříbek et al., 2008). Based  on  a  reconnaissance  geological  survey  conducted  in  November-December  2010,  the 
Dem  region  consists  of  metamorphosed  basalt,  siltstone,  iron  formations  and  shale  units  that  are 
unconformably  overlain  by  a  10  m  thick  silcrete-laterite-ferricrete  duricrust. The  Dem  mine  site  is 
hosted  in  shale  and  manganiferous  ironstone  units. An  iron-rich  laterite-ferricrete  duricrust  formed 
during the Cretaceous and Miocene (Dequincey et al., 2006) and is a local source of iron ore. 1.4. || and accessory plagioclase (Figure 5.1b). The siltstone and shale units are graphitic and carbonaceous 
and sometimes manganiferous. The  basalt-andesite  units  in  the  Dem  study  area  are  generally  massive,  and  sometimes 
amygdaloidal. They  are  strongly  to  weakly  altered  and  typically  chloritized. They  are  composed  of 
fine to very fine assemblage of plagioclase, clinopyroxene (altered to chlorite), and biotite altered to 
chlorite (Figure 5.1c). Quartz and rarely carbonate fills vugs as amygdules. || resources (iron ore, charcoal, clay, water and flux), (2) the choice of trees for making charcoal and 
transporting them to the processing site, (3) clay collection for furnace construction and production of 
tuyere  and  crucibles,  and  (4)  distribution  of  the  final  product  after  smelting. Presumably,  historic 
smelters  could  possibly  choose  the  smelting  site  near  at  least  one  resource. Certainly,  the  iron-rich 
resources  at  Dem  gave  reason  for  the  other  industries  to  exist;  tuyere,  crucible  and  furnace  brick 
production is interpreted to have taken place locally from orange aeolian sand which covers the Dem 
study area. Charcoal was the most appropriate fuel for the smelting of iron ore in ancient times but the type 
of  wood  used  in  the  Dem  study  area  is  a  subject  of  speculation. Charcoal  is  a  by-product  of  dry 
distillation  of  wood  and  contains  high  carbon  content  (Karbowniczek,  2005). It  is  advantageous

Artisanal  and  Small-scale  Mining  is  the  oldest  form  of  mining  known  in  Africa  and  Europe 
(c.f., Agricola, 1556). To date, there is no internationally acceptable definition of Artisanal and Small-
scale  Mining  (ASM). The United  Nations  uses the  volume  of  material  mined  as  a  base  criterion  to 
establish the difference between small and large-scale mining (ICMM, 2010), but summarily, artisanal 
mining  involves  mining  activities  conducted  on  ore  bodies  or  deposits  by  persons  using  traditional 
techniques  and/or  low  mechanisation  levels  (Anonymous,  1999)  using  extraction  and  processing  of 
minerals by intensive selective manual labour. ASM mostly occurs in rural areas by artisanal miners 
with inadequate (1) necessary education, (2) management skills, (3) training and (4) essential tools.",rules,PLACE

mixed with the metal before it was melted are driven forth, because the metal is perfected by 
fire in this manner. Since metalliferous ores differ greatly amongst themselves, first as to the

This  study  used  ethnographic  methods  and  research  as  a  first  pass  to  establish  the  history  of 
artisanal  mining  of  iron  in  the  Kaya  region,  and  specifically  the  Dem  region. || It can thus be reasonably interpreted that the Dem site predates modern iron making in the Kaya 
region. Radiocarbon  dates  given  for  the  last  80  years  were  thus  discounted. The  age  of  mining, 
processing and production is thus tentatively constrained by radiocarbon dating to have been active in 
1438-1458 AD, 1600-1651 AD, or 1756-1759 AD. Iron was initially forged in West Africa as early as the 6th century (Insoll, 1997; Pleiner, 2000) 
and iron smelting was practiced in the southeast of Burkina Faso by the Bura  culture whose culture 
was focused in the region 250 km southeast of Dem. Iron forging and smelting was thus known to the 
peoples of West Africa. By the 15th century, forging and smelting of iron (and gold) where central to 
the region and particularly, the Songhay economy which dominated trade in the region. || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known 
but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not 
been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly 
not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of 
Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the 
Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the 
Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through 
the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon 
people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion

Frontispiece “Wherefore smelting is necessary, for by this means earths, solidified juices, and stones 
are separated from the metals so that they obtain their proper colour and become pure, and may 
be of great use to mankind in many ways. When the ore is  smelted, those things which were 
mixed with the metal before it was melted are driven forth, because the metal is perfected by 
fire in this manner. Since metalliferous ores differ greatly amongst themselves, first as to the 
metals which they contain, then as to the quantity of the metal which is in them, and then by the 
fact that some are rapidly melted by fire and others slowly, there are, therefore, many methods 
of smelting.” (Agricola, 1556)

pipe). During the process, iron oxides in the ore are reduced to iron within the furnace and the reduced 
iron particles fall into a melt of slag formed near the air inlet. Three vital chemical reactions inside the furnace occur during smelting, (1) carbon monoxide 
(CO) that is formed by reaction of oxygen in the air and carbon present in the fuel, (2) the reduction of 
iron oxide to metallic iron, and (3) the formation of slag. In the process of smelting roasted ore, flux

In West Africa, the volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Birimian Supergroup contain iron (Milési

profile  that  provide  laterite  mantles  and  screes  to  younger  ferricrust  (Beauvais  and  Chardon,  2013; 
WAXI, 2013). Lateritization processes regulate the weathering products through extreme leaching of

of iron oxide, silica and alumina (Nahon 1991; Tardy 1993).",rules,PLACE

and  French  colonials  battling  for  control  over  coastal  ports. Europeans  conflicted  over  land 
throughout  West  African  countries  and  brought  slave  trade  into  Fulani  and  Wassoulou  Empire 
(Swartz,  1980). In  1756-1759,  from  one-  to  two-thirds  of  the  whole  population  of  the  Fulani  jihad 
states  comprised  enslaved  people. This  period  was  followed  by  the  colonial  period  that  took  place 
from 1895-1958 and French colonials took control over West Africa. 65 || Interestingly,  although  quite  limited  in  number,  the  ages  correspond  broadly  with  the  rapid 
expansion  of  iron  technology  from  1400-1600  AD  in  West  Africa  (Todd,  1979). They  correspond 
with the rise of the Songhai Empire in the 15th century, and slavery in the 17-18th centuries and/or the 
first European exploration into West Africa. Thus the radiocarbon ages may represent historical ages 
of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for 
in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso. However,  Insol  (2000)  indicated  that  iron  technology  in  the  period 
1400-1600 AD was one of a series of fundamental social assets that assisted the growth of significant 
centralized kingdoms, particularly the Songhay Empire (under the rule of Sonni Ali) which was seated 
in  Djenne  or Timbuktu  or  Gao. These  towns  are  respectively  situated  360  km  west,  450  km  north-
northwest and 370 km northeast of Dem across the international border of present day Burkina Faso 
and Mali. || It can thus be reasonably interpreted that the Dem site predates modern iron making in the Kaya 
region. Radiocarbon  dates  given  for  the  last  80  years  were  thus  discounted. The  age  of  mining, 
processing and production is thus tentatively constrained by radiocarbon dating to have been active in 
1438-1458 AD, 1600-1651 AD, or 1756-1759 AD. Iron was initially forged in West Africa as early as the 6th century (Insoll, 1997; Pleiner, 2000) 
and iron smelting was practiced in the southeast of Burkina Faso by the Bura  culture whose culture 
was focused in the region 250 km southeast of Dem. Iron forging and smelting was thus known to the 
peoples of West Africa. By the 15th century, forging and smelting of iron (and gold) where central to 
the region and particularly, the Songhay economy which dominated trade in the region. || Kribek,  B.,  Syrokorova,  I.,  Machovic,  V.,  Laufek,  F.,  2008. Graphitization  of  organic  matter  and

background to this study (a, b, e). Their information indicated that no artisanal mining for iron 
had taken place at Dem in their lifetimes. The senior elders ranged in age from 75-104 and they 
were  the  senior  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. Consequently,  it  can  be 
reasonably  assumed  that  the  Dem  site  is  older  than  80  years. || Figure 1.3: Photographs of the elders of the village of Liligomde who provided the ethnographic background to

source for iron ore for the agricultural industry (Figure 4.2), such as near the village of Liligomde near 
Kaya). In  the  Dem  region,  ferricrete  overlying  iron-rich  shale  was  clearly  mined  artisanally  as  a 
source  of  iron,  along  with  primary  iron  in  the  alteration  selvages  around  buck  quartz  veins  that 
crosscut the iron-rich shale. Laterite-ferricrete type iron ores are derived from the sub-aerial alteration of rocks (Beukes et 
al., 2002). || The presence of iron in the Dem region was known 
but the iron was not used for fabrication purposes. The Museum of Kaya also supported the ethnographic evidence and added that research has not 
been undertaken on iron mining, processing and production anywhere in Burkina Faso and certainly 
not  in  the  Dem  region. There  was  a  record  that  research  had  been  undertaken  in  the  village  of 
Liligomde, but the results of that work does not appear in the published works or reports held by the 
Museum of Kaya. Interestingly,  consultations  with  the  significant  elders  about  the  history  of  iron  mining  in  the 
Kaya region quickly recounted that iron mining and working as having arrived from the north through 
the  village  of  Aribindi  in  the  Oudalan  province  (northeast  Burkina  Faso)  by  Chief  Abukonde. Ethnographic research also revealed that iron technology was brought to Burkina Faso by the Dogon 
people of Mali before the Mossi Kingdom was established in 1543 in Burkina Faso (Brunner-Robion 
et al., 2003). There was no  ethnographic evidence  of iron mining, processing and production  in the 
Dem region; iron mining in the Dem region took place before the senior elders became blacksmiths, 
or before 1920-1930 AD.",llm,PLACE

which are the two local centres of artisanal mining for iron and gold. No interviews were held without 
the  expressed  permission  of  the  senior  elders  of  the  villages. Data  was  recorded  in  a  notebook; 
translations  from  Mossi  to  French  and  English  where  facilitated  by  Mr  Bamogo  Makido  of  the 
Museum of Kaya and all notes were recorded in English. Several consultations were specifically conducted with two groups of senior elders (ages ranged 
from 75 to 101 years of age) of the village of Liligomde near Kaya (Figure 1.3), who were the former 
chief  blacksmiths  of  the  Chief  Naba  of  the  Mossi  people. The  results  of  the  consultations  clearly 
argued that mining of iron in the Dem region, or any significant artisanal mining in the Dem region 
for any metal commodity, had not occurred in the last 80-90 years, i.e., mining in the Dem region is 
not recorded in oral tradition of the significant elders of the Mossi people. In fact, the consultations 
recorded that mining for iron for primarily agricultural purposes only took place at a site immediately 
west of the village of Liligomde and not at Dem.",llm,PLACE
