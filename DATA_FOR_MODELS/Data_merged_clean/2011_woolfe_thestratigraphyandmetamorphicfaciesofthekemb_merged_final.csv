the iron-formation and the metaclastics was not observed, the increase in metamorphic grade 
and  facing  direction  suggests  that  these  sequences  occur  lower  in  the  stratigraphy. The 
occurrence of the banded ironstone formation is typical of shallow water environments of the 
Proterozoic (Leeder, 1999). This  would have occurred distal  to  a delta setting on a shelf or

2011_Woolfe_The stratigraphy and metamorphic facies of the KEMB.txt,Clarke,46,"7.3 Migmatite formation 
A  migmatite  results  from  the  partial  melting  of  a  pre-existing  rock. The  formation  of 
migmatites is generally associated with an increase in pressure and temperature as either an 
increase in  depth,  known as “static melting”, or  an increase in  differential  stress,  known as 
“dynamic melting” (Ashworth, 1985 and Sawyer, 2008). In the absence of free fluid, melting 
reactions occur at  granulite facies conditions,  typically at  temperature between 800 to  1000 
⁰C (Vernon and Clarke, 2008). However  the  occurrence  of  the  migmatite  in  the  KEMB  is  not  associated  with  a  typical 
increase in temperature and pressure along a geothermal as described above. This is due to its 
anomalous  position  between  greenschist  and  amphibolite  facies. Outcrop  suggest  the 
migmatite has  little lateral  extent and is isolated to  an area of only several  hundred metres.",rules,PLACE

leucosome and biotite-rich melanosome, are interpreted to have formed by the breakdown of 
muscovite (Sawyer, 2008). Although the Saint-Malo migmatites have been proposed to have 
formed  in  upper  amphibolite  facies,  the  presence  of  muscovite  in  the  metamorphosed  rock

The petrographic study included 16 thin section samples of the Kel Enguef metamorphic belt. These  were  chosen  as  representative  samples  of  the  stratigraphy. The  focus  of  the 
petrographic study was on the textural features and mineral assemblages in order to establish 
the original rock types and the conditions which lead to metamorphism of the metamorphic 
samples. The study splits the samples into the various facies. Intrusive samples focus on the 
mineralogy. || Abstract 
The  Kel  Enguef  metamorphic  belt  is  host  to  metamorphosed  clastic  and  chemical 
sedimentary  rocks  that  are  intruded  by  gabbro  dykes  and  a  diorite  pluton. The 
metamorphosed  clastic  and  sedimentary  rocks  were  deposited  in  a  deltaic  setting  into  a 
shallow  marine  environment. The  sequences  comprise  fine-  to  coarse-grained  sedimentary 
rocks  that  exhibit  an  overall  upward  coarsening  stratigraphy. The  metamorphism  and 
deformation of the sequences is interpreted to have occurred mainly as a result of burial. Both 
greenschist and amphibolite grade metamorphism have been recognised. Gradation between 
these two facies is not observed. || STUDY AREA

Saint-Malo, France, with a very similar mineral assemblage of muscovite-plagioclase-quartz 
leucosome and biotite-rich melanosome, are interpreted to have formed by the breakdown of 
muscovite (Sawyer, 2008). Although the Saint-Malo migmatites have been proposed to have 
formed  in  upper  amphibolite  facies,  the  presence  of  muscovite  in  the  metamorphosed  rock
