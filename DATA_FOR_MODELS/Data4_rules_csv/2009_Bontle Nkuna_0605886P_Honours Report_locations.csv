The Oudalan-Gorouol greenstone belt is located in north-eastern Burkina Faso (Fig. 1.1) in the West 
African  craton,  and  extends  into  the  neighbouring  Niger. The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by 
meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et 
al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can 
be found throughout the belt (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The ore genesis of Essakane, Falagountou and Sokadie areas has not been defined. Researchers have
