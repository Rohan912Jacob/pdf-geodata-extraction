Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold 
deposit. The  Sadiola  open  cast  occurs  with  the  FE3  and  FE4  open  cast  within  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments 
which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism 
reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral 
assemblages. The Sadiola deposit is hosted by the Kofi Formation which is currently undated. The Kofi 
Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates.",Sadiola,GPE,spacy

The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3 
and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société 
d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit

5.1 Depositional Environment 
The development of seismites is interpreted as a result of either a seismic activity. These correlate with 
the seismites recorded by Mazumder et al (2006) which are deformations that occurred in unconsolidated 
sediments mainly as a result of shock. Soft sediment deformation is represented by slump facies recorded 
on both the Helicopter pit and the drill cores. Slumping in interpreted to have succeeded the deposition of 
the sediments and these occur mainly in continental slopes, seismically active environments and prior to 
the  consolidation  of  sediments. The  slump  sequence  of  the  main  Sadiola  open  cast  can  therefore  be 
correlated  with  that  of  the  ancilliary  pits  defined  by  Matabane  (2008). They  can  also  be  interpreted  to 
have formed due to overloading, rapid sedimentation, over-steepening of slopes by earthquakes (Bagati, 
2008).",Bagati,GPE,spacy
2010_Matsheka_Irvin Final Thesis.txt,31,"5.2 Structural Interpretation 
The two deformation phases that are identified in the study areas of the Sadiola goldfield correlate with 
the  deformation  phases  interpreted  by  Hein  (2009)  in  the  Goren  greenstone  belt  in  Burkina  Faso, 
Tshibubudze  et  al.,  (2009)  in  the  Markoye  Shear  Zone  in  Burkina  Faso. The  first  deformation  is 
characterized  by  the  development  of  NNW-trending  folds  (F1). NNW  bedding  and  cleavage  (S1) 
orientation associated with D1 are recorded in the study area. This deformation is termed the Tangaean 
Event and formed during the NE-SW shortening period. Quartz veins formed during this event and their 
dominant trend is towards NNE-NE. The second deformation event is characterized by the development of ENE-ESE trending folds (F2) and 
NE-trending  cleavage  (S2).",Burkina,GPE,spacy

3.1 The geology of the West African Craton and the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier 
The West African Craton (Fig. 2) is a piece of continental crust that has been stable since approximately 
1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The 
Reguibat Rise and the Man terrains are composed of Archaean to Proterozoic rock formations (Potrel et 
al., 1998) with the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Man shield referred to as the Birimian sequence (Beziat 
et al., 2000). The Kêniêba and Kayes inliers are situated towards the western border of Senegal and Mali (Fig.",Man,GEO,geotext

* The western domain is composed of the Mako Supergroup, which is a volcanic sequence that consists of 
tholeiitic  basalt  and  andesite. It  also  consists  of  tholeiitic  pillowed  basalt. The  pillowed  basalt  have  an 
NMORB affinity, while the massive basalt has an enriched MORB composition. It is also characterised 
by  folded  low-grade  metamorphic  rocks  which  are  intruded  by  granitic  and  mafic  bodies.",Wilson,GEO,geotext

porphyroblastic  texture. Green  to  brown  biotite  and  cordierite  mineralogy  is  observed  in  contact-
