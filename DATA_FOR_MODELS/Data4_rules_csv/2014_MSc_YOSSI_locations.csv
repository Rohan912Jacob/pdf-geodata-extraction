2014_MSc_YOSSI.txt,9,"when choosing a reliable model that matches and responds well to the real distribution of subsurface 
properties among a multitude of other solutions. Also  most  geological  structures  are  not  detectable  by  only  one  geophysical  method,  which 
therefore  requires  a  combination  of  several  geophysical  methods  to  constrain  structures  and 
geological  domains. The  combination  of  geophysical  methods  is  an  optimization  that  supports  the 
geophysical interpretation and contributes in determining the geological elements that are important in 
developing an understanding of the subsurface geology. The limitation in optimisation is the cost of 
applying multiple geophysical techniques and methods. With this in mind, this project aims to use a combination of geophysical methods for modelling 
by integrating the available geological data to build a 3D geophysical model of the study area, and to 
interpret  geological  structures  and  geological  domains. Specifically,  the  aims  are  to  (1)  establish 
tectonic domains in the south of Mali and northeast of Guinea; (2) to determine if structures (shears, 
faults, etc.) beneath the thin sedimentary cover (up to 100m) potential to host structurally-hosted gold 
mineralization  for  known  gold  deposit;  and  (3)  constrain  a  strato-tectonic  history  for  the  region  of

Geophysical  modelling  is  never  able  to  determine  the  exact  geology  in  a  complex  zone, 
particularly if there is no geological information known for the area of study (Mickus, 2008; Lelievre, 
2009). A geophysical model can only be used to characterise the subsurface geology, and to expand 
and  verify  the  geological  information  already  available,  which  can  be  confirmed  with  drilling  of 
boreholes. Geological  information  is  qualitative  and/or  quantitative. It  includes  drill  hole,  lithological, 
geochemical, structural, and relative and absolute geochronology data. This information is collected

The West African Craton includes the Reguibat Shield in the north of the craton and the Leo Man 
Shield  in  the  south  (Figure  1.1). These  shields  represent  two  nuclei  which  formed  in  two  stages  of 
crustal  evolution  in  West  Africa  (Naba,  2007). The  shields  are  overlain  by  three  main  sedimentary 
basins; the  Tindouf basin in  the north,  the  Taoudeni basin in  the  centre, and  the Volta basin in  the 
southeast of the craton. The  West  African  craton  is  considered  as  stable  since  the  end  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic  at
