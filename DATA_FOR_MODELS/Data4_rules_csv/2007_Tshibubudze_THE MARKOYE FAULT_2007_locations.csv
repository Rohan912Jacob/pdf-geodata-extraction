crustal-scale  structure,  have  undergone  at  least  two  phases  of  deformation,  D1  and  D2, 
with reactivation during the late phase of D2. D1 resulted in formation of NW-trending 
asymmetric folds and thrusts at Essakane, and the displacement along the Markoye fault 
was dextral reverse. D2 is a period of SE-NW crustal shortening that formed NE-trending 
folds,  and  NE-trending  regional  foliation. The  NE-trending  mylonite  to  ultramylonite 
zone, pseudotachylyte veins, buck quartz-carbonate (± tourmaline) veins and quartz iron-
rich catalasite vein, and late quartz-chlorite shears formed during D2. D1 is interpreted to pre-date the Eburnean Orogeny, and D2 is correlated to the Eburnean

The  NE-trending  Markoye  fault  in  Burkina  Faso  is  a  first-order  crustal  scale  structure 
located in the north-eastern part of Burkina Faso, between the towns of Dori and Tambão 
by the boarder with Mali and Niger (Fig. 1). The structure has been interpreted as a major

Jeabrum (1970) in Rogers and Dong (2000) defined the structure as an east-verging thrust 
and  BHP  geologists  interpreted  the  structure  as  part  of  a  regional  dextral  strike-slip

Although  limited  by  the  availability  of  outcrops  due  to  the  Sahara  sand  dunes,  laterite, 
and  alluvial  cover,  two  stratigraphic  sequences  are  recognised  in  the  study  area; 
volcanoclastic  and  sedimentary. These  units  are  metamorphosed  to  hornblende-hornfels 
facies through contact metamorphism, but primary sedimentary structures are preserved 
as  compositional  layers  (Chapter  4). Primary  structures  include  graded  bedding,  flaser 
and cross-bedding, fine laminations, ripple marks, slumps, and scour and fill. The  primary  structures  indicate  a  single  environment  of  deposition:  shallow  marine 
continental shelf at a delta front setting. The fining up sequence (graded bedding), slumps 
(gravity  flow),  mud  and  sand  balls,  lithic  fragments,  ripples,  scour  and  fill,  mud-cracks

subjected  to  tidal  and  or  turbidity  currents  (Eriksson  et  al.,  1998;  2005;  Sultan  and

The  NE-trending  Markoye  fault  in  Burkina  Faso  is  a  first-order  crustal  scale  structure 
located in the north-eastern part of Burkina Faso, between the towns of Dori and Tambão 
by the boarder with Mali and Niger (Fig. 1). The structure has been interpreted as a major 
westerly-dipping  thrust  (Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Hottin  and  Ouedraogo,  1992). Delfour  and 
Jeabrum (1970) in Rogers and Dong (2000) defined the structure as an east-verging thrust 
and  BHP  geologists  interpreted  the  structure  as  part  of  a  regional  dextral  strike-slip 
system. Castaing  et  al. (2003)  interpreted  the  same  structure  as  a  sinistral  fault  system,

The  regional  lithological  and  structural  mapping  completed  in  the  north-eastern  part  of 
Burkina Faso indicates that the Essakane goldfield of the West African Craton is hosted 
by  meta-volcanoclastic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  sequences. The 
sequences  are  dominated  by  meta-volcanoclastic  greywackes,  intercalated  meta-
conglomerate,  meta-sandstone-greywacke,  siltstone  and  shale. The  sequences  have 
primary sedimentary structures preserved as compositional layering. The  depositional  environment  of  the  sequences  is  interpreted  to  have  occurred  in  a 
shallow  marine  continental  shelf  environment  at  a  delta  front  setting. The  sequences 
where  subjected  to  several  phases  of  deformation  and  metamorphism. They  have  been 
contact metamorphosed to hornblende hornfels facies during emplacement of adamellite, 
pyroxenite-gabbro, granodiorite-tonalite plutons, and dolerite dykes.",West African Craton,regex-GEO,regex
