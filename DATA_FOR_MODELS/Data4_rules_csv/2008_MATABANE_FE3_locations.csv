The  FE3  open  casts  (Sadiola  goldfield,  Mali)  are  operated  by  the  by  the  Société 
d’Exploitation des Mines d’Or de Sadiola S.A.. The open casts comprise meta-sedimentary 
rocks  that  can  be  divided  into  five  units;  lower  slump  facies,  upper  slump  facies,  siltstone-
greywacke  unit,  greywacke  unit  and  a  laterite  profile. The  lower  slump  facies  consists  of 
siltstone beds and is characterised by massive chaotic slump folds and olistoliths. The upper 
slump  facies  consists  of  greywacke-siltstone  beds  and  is  characterised  by  turbidite  beds, 
slump  folds  and  fluid  escape  structures. The  siltstone-greywacke  unit  is  characterised  by 
turbidite beds. The greywacke unit is carbonaceous.",Sadiola,GPE,spacy
2008_MATABANE_FE3.txt,7,"Chapter 1: Introduction 
1.1 Preamble 
The FE3 open cast is situated in the Sadiola goldfield in Mali. The goldfield also includes the 
giant Sadiola and FE4 open casts which are mined by the Société d’Exploitation des Mines 
d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A.,  and  is  a  Joint  Venture  partnership  between  AngloGold  Ashanti, 
IAMGOLD, the Malian Government and the IFC. Gold production at Sadiola goldfield began 
in mid-1997: the FE3 open cast is currently in the feasibility stages. The  geology  and  metallogenic  setting  of  the  FE3  open  cast  has  not  been  investigated, 
mapped  or  researched  to  date. Therefore  the  relationship  between  the  stratigraphy, 
structures  and  intrusive  rocks  is  not  known,  but  it  is  considered  by  Sadiola  mine  geology 
team to be important in determining the tectonic setting and the timing of gold mineralization 
in the goldfield. Therefore  the  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  describe  the  stratigraphy,  structure  and 
intrusive rocks that occur in the goldfield.",Mali,GPE,spacy

gold mineralization will be determined. Determining the relative timing of gold mineralization 
will  assist  in  predicting  the  occurrence  of  gold  in  new  exploration  projects  in  the  Sadiola 
area. 1.2 Location and physiography 
The FE3 open cast is located in the Sadiola area in Mali, West Africa. The Sadiola goldfield 
is located 80 km west of the capital city of Bamako on the western border of Senegal and 
Mali  (Fig. 1). Mali  is  a  landlocked,  Sahel  country  and  is  mostly  semi-desert  or  desert.",West Africa,GPE,spacy

The  main  objective  of  the  project  is  to  define  the  stratigraphy  in  the  study  area  by  sub-
dividing the facies successions. Furthermore, detailed mapping of structures (if present) will 
be  done  with  the  purpose  of  determining  the  relative  timing  of  structural  events. Another

established. Also,  where  appropriate  a  photographic  record  was  made  and  samples  were

The  lithologies  of  the  FE3  opencasts  (FE3_1,  FE3_2  and  FE3_3)  are  composed  of 
sedimentary  rocks. The  rocks  can  be  divided  into  four  major  units;  lower  slump  facies,  an 
upper  slump  facies,  a  siltstone-greywacke  and  a  greywacke  unit  (Table  2). They  are 
unconformably  overlain  by  a  laterite  profile  which  is  a  result  of  post-Palaeoproterozoic 
weathering processes. The rocks of the FE3 opencast are deformed, which resulted in the development of breccia

5.1 Depositional Environment 
Slumps  characterise  the  lower  and  upper  slump  facies. A  slump  is  a  mass-transported 
debris  flow  (Martinsen,  1994;  Shanmugam,  2000)  along  the  edge  of  a  continental  margin. They are a downslope movement of sediment and rock material above a basal shear surface 
where  there  is  significant  internal  distortion  of  the  bedding  (Stow,  1986). Slump  structures 
form  when  the  sedimentary  pile  abruptly  detaches  from  a  slope  and  is  transported 
downslope (Collinson et al., 1991). A sediment pile will transport downslope when the shear 
stress acting within a body of sediment exceeds the shear strength along the slope surface 
(Dingle, 1980). The sedimentary pile deforms internally (intensely), and produces a variety of 
deformation  structures  such  as  folds,  boudins,  and  micro-faults  (Martinsen,  1994),  all  of 
which are observed in the study area (Fig.",Stow,GEO,geotext

Antarctica  (Farell,  1984;  Shanmugam,  2000),  and  typically  along  the  edge  of  continental 
margins. The  slumps  of  Country  Clare  in  Ireland  represent  collapsed  slope  deposits  that 
were laid down on an unstable basin slope (Collinson et al., 1991). The slumps of Alexandra 
Island represent mass transported sediments along dislodged from the continental slope into 
a deep marine environments. Modern slumps are common along continental margins and in 
modern  deltas  (  The  Storegga  slumps  in  Norwegian  continental  margin;  Conway  coast  in

gulf of Mexico) (Shanmugam et al.,1988; Jansen et al., 1987; Damuth, 1993; McConnico et 
al., 2007). Slumping can be triggered by gravity, downslope undercutting, and thickening of 
the  sediment  pile  by  deposition,  slumping  up-slope  or  seismic  activity  (Dingle,  1980;
