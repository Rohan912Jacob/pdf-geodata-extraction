2013_Peters.txt,3,"ABSTRACT 
The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism.",Burkina,GPE,spacy

1.5. Thesis Organisation 
This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:- 
(1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related 
ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis.",Washington,GPE,spacy

A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political 
instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were 
restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against 
unnecessary  travel. The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area. However,  a 
comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano-
sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study. 21",Burkina Faso,LOC,spacy

The emplacement of tonalite-trondjemite-granodiorite (TTG) plutons and granites in the WAC

West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba

GB (e.g., hyaloclastites, jointing and volcanic glass). For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well

1.1. Preamble 
Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in 
Ghana  (Kitson,  1918)  and  were  classified  as  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  lavas.",Wright,GEO,geotext

sequence  of  the  southern  GB. These  include  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sediments,  siltstone, 
volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit. Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  common  in  the  southern  GB  (Section  4.3.5;

2013_Peters.txt,76,"The presence of 
conglomerate beds and mud clasts, possibly due to rip-up action within the greywacke units suggests 
energetic and erosive deposition (Walker, 1992). The greywacke units of the GB are composed of coarse-grained, angular to sub-rounded quartz, 
plagioclase  and  intact  clinopyroxene  grains  (Sections  4.3.3,  5.2.1). Clinopyroxene  and  plagioclase 
grains are readily altered during transportation processes (Albarede, 2003), suggesting that deposition 
of the greywackes in the southern GB took place proximal to the source. Consequently, the greywacke 
was likely derived from a volcano-(plutonic) source nearby. The pyroclastic breccia unit of the GB is a polylithic, poorly bedded, poorly sorted deposit that 
is interbedded within the greywacke succession (Section 4.3.4). The breccia is composed of euhedral 
quartz,  plagioclase,  volcanic  hornblende  and  anhedral  clinopyroxene  crystals  cemented  with  a  fine-

coefficients  for  phosphorus  and  reported  that  phosphorus  is  more  likely  to  substitute  for  silica  in 
garnet,  clinopyroxene  and  Ca-perovskite,  and  determined  that  phosphorus  partitioned  into  Ca-
perovskite  >  majorite  garnet  >  pyrope  garnet  >  clinopyroxene  with  negligible  amounts  partitioning 
into olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel. In attempt to quantify the likelihood of phosphorus retention in the magma source in general for 
GB samples, a simple calculation was done (Appendix C) to determine how much  phosphorus could 
be retained in garnet and clinopyroxene in ancient magmas. The assumption was made that 0.05 wt% 
P2O5 was present in these magmas and 15 % partial melting occurred. The primitive mantle value for

LREE  depletions,  where  the  LREE  depletion  is  less  than  N-type  MORBs. It  was  suggested  that  an 
intermediate  geochemistry  between  back-arc  basins  and  island-arc  tholeiites  made  such  an 
environment an attractive setting, especially due to regionally low Nb concentrations (Zonou, 1987), 
but  the  lack  of  ultramafic  rocks  (Burke,  1988)  and  unfitting  isotopic  and  trace  element  signatures

banding has been recorded in the Archaean Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa (Robbins et al.,

Effusive eruptions are typical of basaltic liquids, particularly when submerged beneath the confining 
water column. Effusive eruptions are characterized by the ability of lava to flow (low viscosity) rather 
than explode (Parfitt and Wilson, 2008) because volatiles escape passively through vesicle formation 
(McPhie et al., 1993; Bardintzeff and McBirney, 2000; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). The  coherent  and  autoclastic  facies  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  proximally  to  the  volcanic
