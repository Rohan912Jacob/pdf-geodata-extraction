2.1. Preamble 
The  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  in  north-east 
Burkina  Faso  (Fig. 1). Besides  the  research  completed  by  Tshibubudze  et  al. (2009)  which

previously  mapped  or  described.",Burkina,GPE,spacy

The study area is situated approximately 2 km east of the town of Markoye and is located 12 
km west of the international border of Niger and 38 km south of the border of Mali (Fig. 2). The town of Markoye is located at the divide between the Sahel and the Sahara; everything 
north of the town is considered to be the Sahara Desert. Thus, the field area is an arid and hot 
environment with much of the surface covered with sand and loose gravels making outcrop 
difficult to find in the low-lying areas. The areas of high relief however, are desert mountains 
that contain a large amount of rock which, unfortunately, was dominated by  loose boulders 
and very little in situ-outcrop.",Markoye,GPE,spacy

Using  the  sedimentary  features,  its  composition  and  the  type  of  sediments  deposited,  a 
probable basin setting can be determined. The sediments were deposited in a retro-arc basin, 
probably a back-arc basin. The basin was situated behind an ancient magmatic arc, which was 
caused  by  subduction. Such  an  extensional  environment  is  suitable  for  depositing  large 
quantities of sediment in a relatively short time (Ravanas, 1991; Ravanas and Furnes, 1995; 
Carter and Naish, 1998). This is synonymous with the greywacke succession of the study area 
which has an approximate thickness of 4.5 kilometres.",Furnes,GPE,spacy

correlation  to  the  sediments  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  and  particularly  the  4  km  thick 
sequence of greywacke in the study area. It is typical for thick sedimentary sequences to be 
deposited  during  the  spreading  of  a  back-arc  environment  like  in  back-arc  environments  in 
Norway  (between  Solund  and  Bremanger)  and  New  Zealand  (Ravanas,  1991;  Ravanas  and 
Furnes, 1995; Carter and Naish., 1998). Sediment sourced from the arc settings  was transported in river systems that travelled from 
the uplifted regions, towards the basin. The sediment was then deposited in a deltaic system. The  greywackes  were  deposited  in  this  deltaic  system  on  a  steep  submarine  slope  which 
allowed for rapid deposition, gravity sliding and slumping, synonymous with turbiditic flows. The erosion rate of the arc is interpreted as getting progressively slower throughout the filling

The  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  are  largely  made  up  of 
supracrustal,  island-arc  derived  sediments  including,  but  not  limited  to,  thick  greywacke 
sequences. These were deposited in a deltaic-shelf environment on the margin of a back-arc 
basin. The  local  stratigraphy  has  been  constrained  by  facies  variation  determined  by 
sedimentary  features  and  differences  in  the  depositional  environment. Regional  low-middle 
greenschist  metamorphism  is  shown  by  the  ubiquitous  presence  of  chlorite,  epidote  and 
minor  muscovite  and  is  suggested  to  be  a  result  of  large  TTG  pluton  emplacement  that 
occurred  syn-tectonically  with  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. This  thesis  proposes  it  is  due  to 
diastathermal  metamorphism  caused  by  back-arc  extension  and  mantle  upwelling. Contact 
metamorphism of the greywacke to hornblende-hornfels facies occurs within close proximity 
of  the  calc-alkaline  dykes.",Oudalan-Gourouol Greenstone Belt,regex-GEO,regex

due  to  the  increase  in  temperature. Two  deformation  events  occurred,  the  Tangaean  Event 
(2170-2130  Ma)  and  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (2130-1980  Ma)  that  caused  the  rocks  in  the 
OGGB to be folded twice. The Ludovic Fault System was a result of compression during the 
Eburnean Orogeny and gave rise to N-S trending, dextral-reverse structures. Dilation of these 
structures  occurred  due  to  compression  of  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. Granodiorite  and 
monzodiorite  dykes  that  intruded  the  Palaeoproterozoic  sedimentary  rocks  were  emplaced 
pre-D1  and  underwent  deuteric  alteration. They  contain  large,  euhedral  plagioclase  and
