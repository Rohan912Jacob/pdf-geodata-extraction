The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as 
Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri. However,  the  Craton  is  still  largely  unexplored  and  its 
formation,  evolution  and  how  and  when  the  gold  deposits  it  hosts  developed  during  the 
Eburnean  orogeny  remain  unclear. The  Siguiri  district  is  one  of  West  Africa's  largest 
Paleoproterozoic  sedimentary  basins  and  sits  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. The 
district and its hosting Basin have received limited attention from the scientific community to 
date. This  thesis  makes  use  of  a  multi-scale  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  in  order  to 
constrain the evolution of the  Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin architecture and hydrothermal

the  first  order  structures  controlling  the  location  of  the  world-class  Siguiri  district  in  the 
eponym Basin. District  to  deposit  scale  structural  work  indicates  that  the  Siguiri  district  underwent 
four  deformation  events:  a  N-S  compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  progressively 
evolving into a transpression and later on into a transtension (early- and late-D3S respectively), 
and a NW-SE compression (D4S). While D1S deformation is cryptic and commonly expressed as 
F1S  recumbent  folds  with  E-W  to  NW-SE  and  NE-SW  striking  axial  traces,  D2S  is  typically 
characterised by F2S upright folds with NNE-SSW to NNW-SSE striking axial planes that refolds 
F1S folds and are responsible for the bulk of the deformation and structural grain observed in 
the Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin. The F2S folds are overprinted by four main orientations of 
structures that develop (or are reactivated) during the early stages of D3S deformation and are 
consistent with a transpressional deformation: N-S thrusts, E-W normal faults, NE-SW dextral 
shear  zones  and  WNW-ESE  sinistral  shear  zones. In  field  exposures  and  in  drill  core,  these 
structures are typically discreet and only expressed as sub-vertical damage zones ten to fifteen 
meters wide and characterised by an increase  in  vein  density or  by  disseminated pyrite.",Basin,LOC,spacy
2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,7,"Comparison of the characteristics and timing of gold 
mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district  with  other  gold  deposits  from  the  West  African  Craton 
indicates that gold mineralisation in Siguiri is coeval with mineralisation in other gold deposits. However,  other  orogenic  gold  deposits  in  the  West  African  Craton  are  associated  with  later 
gold events that may have formed economic concentrations in the rest of the Siguiri Basin. The  conclusions  from  this  multi-scale  multi-disciplinary  work  have  implications  for 
exploration targeting in and around the Siguiri Basin. This thesis highlights the importance of 
the early architecture as a first order control on orogenic gold systems. The expression of the 
second  and  third  order  structures  controlling  the  mineralisation  are  thought  to  develop  in 
response  to  regional stress-switches  that  can  be  recognised  in  the  field. Finally,  at  a  deposit

2)  Use  this  newly  developed  understanding  to  highlight  the  early  architecture  of  the 
Siguiri Basin and the large scale structures which may have played a fundamental role 
in the location of the Siguiri district;

Abstract: 
Geochronology  and  lithostratigraphic  characterisation  of  the  Siguiri  district  in  the 
Paleoproterozoic Birimian terrane of West Africa has provided a reappraisal of the Siguiri Basin 
stratigraphy. This  new  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the  central  part  of  the  Basin  further 
highlights  first  order controls on the location of the world class Siguiri orogenic gold district. Three metasedimentary Formations occur in the Siguiri district, namely: the Balato, Fatoya and 
Kintinian  Formations. These  consist  of  fine-grained  organic-rich  shales,  mudstone  and 
siltstone/greywacke/limestone  interbeds,  decimetre  to  metre-thick  graded  greywacke  beds 
and  debris  flow  deposits. The  Balato  Formation  displays  low-energy,  hemipelagic  marine  or

Depositional environments of the Siguiri district 
The  very  fine-grained  size  of  the  Balato  Formation  deposits  suggests  deposition  in  a 
low energy, marine or lake setting. The dominantly dark colour of the Balato shales suggests 
high content in organic material and deposition in reduced water oxygenation and circulation 
(relatively quiescent phase of sedimentation). The  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Fatoya  Formation  are  interpreted  as  the  product  of

Orogenic gold mineralization is common across the Paleoproterozoic Birimian rocks of 
the West African Craton e.g. Lawrence et al., (2013a); Milési et al. (1989); Milési et al., (1992). The  location  of  orogenic  gold  deposits  is  typically  controlled  by  complex  regional-scale  fault 
networks (Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2000). In West Africa, the Ashanti fault system in 
Ghana, is one example of such a network, and its many faults host some of the biggest vein-
hosted  and  fault-vein-hosted  orogenic  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Obuasi,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002; 
Fougerouse  et  al.,  this  volume). The  Siguiri  district  (240  t/7.9  Moz;  AngloGold  Ashanti  Ltd.,

MINERALISATION FOOTPRINTS AND REGIONAL TIMING 
OF THE SIGUIRI OROGENIC GOLD DISTRICT (GUINEA, 
WEST AFRICA) 
The following paper focuses on deposit to microscopic scale observations and presents 
the  petrographic  and  geochemical  characteristics  of  the  Siguiri  district  and  of  its  gold 
mineralisation. This study is based on field observations, drill core logging, petrography, geochemistry 
and  in situ analyses by LA-ICP-MS of sulphide  minerals acquired  in  three  key deposits of the 
Siguiri district. For each deposit, a log, a cross-section and numerous polished thin-sections are 
presented. Based  on  this  work,  gold  mineralisation  characteristics  were  found  to  be  consistent 
across the different deposits making the Siguiri district. Gold mineralisation in the district was 
found to be  polyphase  and  to have  occurred mainly  during D3S,  but  was  interpreted to have 
also occurred during D4S deformation. The timing of gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district is 
also  constrained  in  this  study  and  compared  with  gold  mineralisation  events  from  other 
orogenic  gold  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton.",Siguiri Orogenic Gold District,LOC,spacy
2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,144,"Introduction 
Orogenic gold deposits typically encompass a wide variety of host rocks, metamorphic 
facies, mineral assemblages and textures, with variations sometimes observed within a single 
deposit (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2005; Groves et al., 2003). Finding the footprint of 
orogenic gold mineralisation therefore represents a great challenge for explorers (e.g. Groves 
et al., 2000; Neumayr et al., 2008). However, as the geochemical and petrological footprints of 
orogenic  gold  deposits  are  more  extensive  than  the  ore  zone  itself  (Eilu  and  Mikucki,  1998; 
Kishida and Kerrich, 1987), characterisation of mineral alteration assemblages  at the deposit 
scale  provides  the  exploration  geologist  with  useful  vectoring  tools  for  targeting  (Eilu  and 
Groves,  2001;  Eilu  et  al.,  1999). With  the  development  in  recent  years  of  laser  ablation 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (LA-ICP-MS)  techniques  and  associated  low 
detection  limits,  studies  on  the  characterization  and  quantification  of  trace  elements  in 
sulphides  associated  with  orogenic  gold  deposits  have  become  more  common  (Large  et  al.,

The  alteration  associated  with  the  superimposition  of  all  four  hydrothermal  events 
was  geochemically  characterised  across  the  Siguiri  district  (Figure  42,  43  and  44). In  the 
different  deposits  and  in  the  representative  Kosise  deposit  in  particular,  the  geochemical 
variations associated with this style of mineralisation are characterised by enrichments in Ag, 
Au, As, Bi, S, Sb, Te and W within the first fifteen meters around the ore shoots at minimum 
(Figure 44). These enrichments relative to the geochemical baseline of the hosting formation, 
are characteristic of hypozonal to mesozonal orogenic gold deposits (Groves et al., 1998; Eilu 
et al., 1999; Groves et al., 2003) and are accompanied, in Siguiri, by additional increases in Co, 
Mo, Na/Al (molar), Se and decreases in Ca, Cs, F, Ga, Hf, 3K/Al (molar), Li, Mg, P and V across 
the  main  ore  shoot. These  variations  can  be  directly  related  to  the  hydrothermal  mineral 
assemblage associated with the V3A and V3B gold mineralisation event.",Wilkinson,GPE,spacy
2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,183,"supported  by  other  studies  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006;  Price  and  Pichler,  2006). Variations  in  As 
content also have a direct impact on the unit cell parameters of the pyrite crystal lattice (a, b, c 
distances between atoms and α, β, γ angles between a, b and c) which affects the capacity of 
this  mineral  to  contain  gold  (Large  et  al.,  2011;  Savage  et  al.,  2000). This  conclusion  is 
highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite: 
more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure 
45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for 
the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the 
Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit. Comparison with other West African orogenic gold deposits 
The  Siguiri  mineralisation  footprint  has  many  similarities  with  other  West  African 
orogenic gold deposits. In particular, mineralisation at the Massawa deposit in Eastern Senegal

Abstract: 
Geochronology  and  lithostratigraphic  characterisation  of  the  Siguiri  district  in  the 
Paleoproterozoic Birimian terrane of West Africa has provided a reappraisal of the Siguiri Basin 
stratigraphy. This  new  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the  central  part  of  the  Basin  further 
highlights  first  order controls on the location of the world class Siguiri orogenic gold district. Three metasedimentary Formations occur in the Siguiri district, namely: the Balato, Fatoya and 
Kintinian  Formations. These  consist  of  fine-grained  organic-rich  shales,  mudstone  and 
siltstone/greywacke/limestone  interbeds,  decimetre  to  metre-thick  graded  greywacke  beds 
and  debris  flow  deposits. The  Balato  Formation  displays  low-energy,  hemipelagic  marine  or

Based  on  the  structural  elements  observed,  and  their  relative  timing,  a  stress-field 
reconstruction was undertaken in the Siguiri district for the syn-D2S ductile and early- to late-
D3S brittle part of the deformation history. Paleo-stress reconstruction for the syn-D2S ductile 
part  of  the  deformation  history,  was  based  on  the  geometry  of  the  F2S  folds  and  the 
orientations  of  their  axial  planes. The  reconstruction  of  the  paleo-stress  orientations  for  the

orientations  assuming  that  locally,  the  Andersonian  fault  and  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  models 
prevailed at the time of faulting and that all V3B conjugate veins were not following pre-existing 
structures. The orientation of σ1 was reconstructed as bisecting the acute angle between two 
conjugate  veins,  while  σ2  lays  at  their  intersection  and  σ3  bisects  the  obtuse  angle  the 
conjugate  makes  (Anderson,  1951;  McClay,  1992). This  analysis  was  only  based  on  V3B 
conjugate sets across the whole district since data from the V3A vein set were insufficient. The D2S E-W compressional event, highlighted by the N-S trending F2S fold axial planes, 
indicates it was related to a horizontal main stress axis (σ1) and a vertical σ3, or overburden

configuration  is  indicative of  transtensional  deformation  during  V3B  veining  (Figure  29C). The 
change in stress-shape ratio from early-D3S transpression where the coeval movement of dip-
slip and strike-slip faults indicate that σ2 ≈ σ3 (low stress-shape ratio; Miller and Wilson, 2004; 
Figure 29B) to syn-V3B (late-D3S) gold mineralization (with σ1 ≈ σ2; Figure 29C) is interpreted to 
have  resulted  from  the  joint  reduction  of  the  maximum  stress  (σ1)  and  further  increase  in 
overburden (σ3 switches to σ2). This is interpreted to have occurred at an early stage of the

the upward migration of mineralizing fluids (Figure 29B and 29C). Stress-switches, precursors or triggers to mineralization 
The timing of gold mineralization during the waning stages of the progressive D2S/D3S

2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,144,"Introduction 
Orogenic gold deposits typically encompass a wide variety of host rocks, metamorphic 
facies, mineral assemblages and textures, with variations sometimes observed within a single 
deposit (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2005; Groves et al., 2003). Finding the footprint of 
orogenic gold mineralisation therefore represents a great challenge for explorers (e.g. Groves 
et al., 2000; Neumayr et al., 2008). However, as the geochemical and petrological footprints of 
orogenic  gold  deposits  are  more  extensive  than  the  ore  zone  itself  (Eilu  and  Mikucki,  1998; 
Kishida and Kerrich, 1987), characterisation of mineral alteration assemblages  at the deposit 
scale  provides  the  exploration  geologist  with  useful  vectoring  tools  for  targeting  (Eilu  and 
Groves,  2001;  Eilu  et  al.,  1999). With  the  development  in  recent  years  of  laser  ablation 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (LA-ICP-MS)  techniques  and  associated  low 
detection  limits,  studies  on  the  characterization  and  quantification  of  trace  elements  in 
sulphides  associated  with  orogenic  gold  deposits  have  become  more  common  (Large  et  al., 
2011; Large et al., 2012; Pitcairn et al., 2006). These studies typically focus on the use of LA-
ICP-MS  data  acquired  on  sulphides  to  resolve  the  controversial  source  of  mineralising  fluids 
(Groves et al., 2003; Tomkins, 2013, Large et al., 2011).",Pitcairn,GEO,geotext
2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,154,"microscopy and semi-quantitative analyses complemented the optical microscopy work. They 
were conducted at the Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis (CMCA) at UWA, 
on  a  Tescan  Vega3  XM  SEM  equipped  with  an  Oxford  instrument  X-ACT  energy  dispersive 
detector (EDS). Operating conditions for the SEM-EDS included an accelerating voltage of 15-
20 kV, a working distance of 15 mm, a beam current of 1.5 nA and a detector process time of 4 
s. Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA) was used to determine the Fe and As content in 
the  different  generations  of  sulphides. Iron  concentrations  were  later  used  as  internal 
standards  for  laser  ablation  data  processing. Analyses  were  carried  out  on  a  JEOL  8530F

Whole-rock  major  and  trace  element  compositions  were  measured  on  each  sample 
collected  from  Bidini,  Kosise  and  Sintroko  PB1. The  aim  was  to  identify  1)  the  different 
geochemical  variations  associated  with  mineralisation  between  the  three  sedimentary 
formations hosting the Siguiri district, and; 2) the main geochemical differences between these 
formations. Geochemical analyses (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices) were carried out by Intertek 
Genalysis Laboratories in Perth, using a combination of analytical techniques detailed in Table 
6 in Electronic Appendices. The Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA) Bunbury basalt 
and Kerba granite standards were included to monitor instrument precision. Data precision for 
both  standards  was  typically  within  3%  for  major  elements  and  10%  for  trace  elements. Detection  limits  for  each  element  are  provided  in  Table  6  in  Electronic  Appendices.",Bunbury,GEO,geotext

Comparison  between  least  altered  samples  and  mineralized  samples  of  each  rock 
types and in each formation allow for the characterization of the suite of elements enriched or 
depleted towards the ore zones. In the Kintinian conglomerate (Figure 42B), mineralisation is 
associated with major increases in Au, Ba, Bi, Cu, K, Rb, S, Te, W, Zn, minor increases in F, Fe, 
Mg,  Ni,  Sn  and  minor  decreases  in  As  and  Na  compared  to  the  least  altered  conglomerate 
sample (Table 3 in Electronic Appendices). Geochemical variations linked to mineralisation in 
the  Fatoya  shale  beds  are  associated with major  increases  in  Au,  As,  Bi,  Na,  S, Te, W, minor 
increases in Ag, Cu, Sr and decreases in Ba, K, P, Rb, Zn (Figure  42C).",Normal,GEO,geotext
2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,183,"supported  by  other  studies  (Pitcairn  et  al.,  2006;  Price  and  Pichler,  2006). Variations  in  As 
content also have a direct impact on the unit cell parameters of the pyrite crystal lattice (a, b, c 
distances between atoms and α, β, γ angles between a, b and c) which affects the capacity of 
this  mineral  to  contain  gold  (Large  et  al.,  2011;  Savage  et  al.,  2000). This  conclusion  is 
highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite: 
more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure 
45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for 
the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the 
Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit. Comparison with other West African orogenic gold deposits 
The  Siguiri  mineralisation  footprint  has  many  similarities  with  other  West  African 
orogenic gold deposits. In particular, mineralisation at the Massawa deposit in Eastern Senegal 
(Treloar et al., 2014) is structurally controlled and hosted along sub-vertical NE-trending shear

Abstract: 
Geochronology  and  lithostratigraphic  characterisation  of  the  Siguiri  district  in  the 
Paleoproterozoic Birimian terrane of West Africa has provided a reappraisal of the Siguiri Basin 
stratigraphy. This  new  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the  central  part  of  the  Basin  further 
highlights  first  order controls on the location of the world class Siguiri orogenic gold district. Three metasedimentary Formations occur in the Siguiri district, namely: the Balato, Fatoya and 
Kintinian  Formations. These  consist  of  fine-grained  organic-rich  shales,  mudstone  and 
siltstone/greywacke/limestone  interbeds,  decimetre  to  metre-thick  graded  greywacke  beds 
and  debris  flow  deposits. The  Balato  Formation  displays  low-energy,  hemipelagic  marine  or

The following paper presents the structural framework associated with the Siguiri gold 
district  and  its  evolution  through  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  study  is  based  on  field 
observations, geophysical datasets, drill core logging and petrographic observations. This work

deformation  history  of  the  Siguiri  district,  the  development  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the 
district and the stress-field variations associated with this mineralisation. Based on this work, 
four  deformation  events  were  recognized  to  affect  the  Siguiri  district  sediments:  a  N-S

MINERALISATION FOOTPRINTS AND REGIONAL TIMING 
OF THE SIGUIRI OROGENIC GOLD DISTRICT (GUINEA, 
WEST AFRICA) 
The following paper focuses on deposit to microscopic scale observations and presents 
the  petrographic  and  geochemical  characteristics  of  the  Siguiri  district  and  of  its  gold 
mineralisation. This study is based on field observations, drill core logging, petrography, geochemistry 
and  in situ analyses by LA-ICP-MS of sulphide  minerals acquired  in  three  key deposits of the 
Siguiri district. For each deposit, a log, a cross-section and numerous polished thin-sections are 
presented. Based  on  this  work,  gold  mineralisation  characteristics  were  found  to  be  consistent 
across the different deposits making the Siguiri district. Gold mineralisation in the district was 
found to be  polyphase  and  to have  occurred mainly  during D3S,  but  was  interpreted to have 
also occurred during D4S deformation. The timing of gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district is 
also  constrained  in  this  study  and  compared  with  gold  mineralisation  events  from  other 
orogenic  gold  deposits  of  the  West  African  Craton.",Of The Siguiri Orogenic Gold District,regex-GEO,regex

This  thesis  presents  an  integrated  lithostratigraphic, geochronological,  structural  and 
geochemical study of the Siguiri district and of its hosting sedimentary basin, the Siguiri Basin. Eleven deposits from the district were studied as well as a number of key locations across the 
Basin. A  wide  variety  of  datasets,  tools  and  analytical  techniques  were  used,  ranging  from 
fieldwork and the taking of structural readings to in-situ LA-ICP-MS. The work was organised
