Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || 2). Early  F1  folds 
observed  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  and  FE3  open  pits  have  been  refolded  by  F2  creating 
interference patterns (Fig. 3, 4A). The F2 folds are disharmonic with upright to inclined 
fold  hinges. They  are  associated  with  a  015º/75ºE  (e.g. Sadiola  Hill,  Tambali, 
Alamoutala)  to  035º/75ºE  (e.g. || 2160 and 2115 Ma (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo 
and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in

2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || 3.1.2. Diamond drill core logging

records  of  mining  dating  back  more  than  250  years  (public  data  from  IAMGold 
website). A geochemical survey was conducted in 1994 over the Alamoutala and Yatela 
prospects, followed by trench sampling in 1996. Drill testing resulted in the discovery 
of  a  significant  gold  resource  at  Yatela  and  a  minor  one  at  Alamoutala. Disseminated 
magnetite  is  abundant  in  host  rocks  at  Alamoutala  but  has  never  been  of  economic 
interest  in  contrast  to  the  magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  district  (see  Fig. || 6.8. Ore mineralogy  
The  shear-hosted  ore  largely  consists  of  pyrite  with  lesser  chalcopyrite  and 
pyrrhotite. The  ore  also  contains  accessory  Ag-Sb-As-Hg-Bi-Te-Mo-W-Zn-Pb-Ni-Co-
U-bearing  mineral  species. A  summary  of  the  ore  and  alteration  paragenesis  at 
Alamoutala is presented in Figure 13 and explained in detail below. Pyrite  is  the  dominant  sulfide  phase  at  Alamoutala  and  occurs  in  numerous  forms, 
including  single  euhedral  to  subhedral  crystals  (generally  50-250  µm),  crystal 
aggregates  (up  to  1  cm),  stringers,  and  massive  pyrite  (Fig. 14A). || 7. Discussion 
7.1. Towards a genetic model for the Alamoutala gold deposit 
The  geological  setting  of  the  Alamoutala  gold  deposit  is  analogous  to  that  of 
magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  iron  district  as  described  in  Schwartz  and  Melcher 
(2004). The  mineralogy,  whole  rock  geochemistry,  and  emplacement  age  of  the 
Alamoutala  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  bodies  are  consistent  with  that  of  the  Falémé 
plutons  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The  silicate  and 
oxide mineral association of endoskarn and exoskarn at Alamoutala indicates an overall 
oxidized  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluid  (e.g.,  formation  of  Fe3+-bearing  andradite, 
relative  abundance  of  magnetite,  garnet  >>  pyroxene)  and  a  shallow  crustal  level  of 
emplacement  (≤5  km)  (e.g.,  Meinert,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). The  Alamoutala 
magnetite skarns, however, have never been of economic interest. || Chapter  III. The  Alamoutala  carbonate-hosted  gold

shears  with  reactivated  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone, 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone, and FE4 Shear Zone) applied a direct control on ore shoot 
geometries in the Sadiola Hill, Alamoutala, FE3, and FE4 gold deposits (Fig. 4E-F). A very late deformation episode (D4s) is associated with a dextral reactivation of earlier 
accretionary  structures. Chlorite-calcite  slickenfibres  on  rare  fault  walls  from  the 
Sadiola  Hill  and Alamoutala  open pits indicate late dextral displacement. Steep NNE-
trending  faults  associated  with  dextral  displacement  have  been  mapped  locally  in 
outcrop  over  the  Finman  plutonic  complex. The  apparent  dextral  offset  of  the  Sadiola

metamorphic  zones 
in  country  rocks. Amphibolite-facies  contact-metamorphic 
assemblages  overprint  regional  greenschist  facies  metamorphism  of  host  rocks  on  the 
basis  of  textural  relationships,  which  indicates  that  the  peak  of  the  regional 
metamorphism  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  KKI  occurred  prior  to  2083  ±  7  Ma. Early 
recrystallization of limestone was followed by the development of both exoskarns and 
endoskarns,  which  resulted  in  the  destruction  of  all  primary  tectono-metamorphic 
texture  in  the  host  rocks  (Fig. 6A). || Figure  8. A)  Representative  chemical  composition  of  pyroxenes  analysed  by  electron  probe. The

Morila gold deposit in southern Mali is constrained to have occurred at 2074 ± 14 Ma 
(hydrothermal  titanite,  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011). In  addition  to  primary  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation, prospectivity in the region is increased due to the exploration potential 
for  Yatela-style  orebodies. Such  orebodies  formed  by  residual  and  supergene  gold 
enrichment processes associated with the development of a deep weathering profile over 
carbonate host rocks. 1.6. Hydrothermal alteration 
Although  gold  deposits  of  the  district  share  equivalent  structural  setting  and 
relative gold timing, the diversity in ore paragenesis, nature and chemistry of wall-rock 
alteration recognised over the camp points toward three distinct styles of mineralisation 
typified by the Sadiola Hill, the Alamoutala, and the Yatela gold deposits (Table 1). The 
typical  gold-related  hydrothermal  alteration  assemblage  in  the  district  is  defined  as 
biotite  +  calcite-dolomite  +  quartz  ±  actinolite-tremolite  ±  muscovite  ±  tourmaline  ±

was done on most accessible ramps of the open pits with a particular emphasis on the 
relationship  between  deformation,  magmatism,  hydrothermal  alteration  and  gold 
mineralisation. 3D geological modelling was performed ahead of the field investigation 
using Leapfrog® Mining and refined with advancing mapping. The trends of ore shoots 
in the orebodies were evaluated using three-dimensional rendering of grade control and

regional  mapping  transects  were  undertaken  using  of  a  rugged  tablet  containing 
geophysical data such as magnetics and radiometrics under ArcGIS. Two transects were 
undertaken  across  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  from  East  to  West  and  two  transects 
investigated  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kofi  basin  all  the  way  to  the  escarpment  of

alteration,  and  ore  mineralogy  of  the  world-class  Sadiola  Hill  carbonate-hosted  gold 
deposit. The  documented  results  are  integrated  with  available  data  on  other  gold 
deposits in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier to form the basis of a metallogenic model. The  second  manuscript  (chapter  III)  presents  the  geology,  tectonic  setting,  contact 
metamorphism,  absolute  timing  and  whole  rock  geochemistry  of  the  local  intrusive 
stocks, hydrothermal alteration, and ore mineralogy of the Alamoutala gold deposit. The 
results  are  used  to  discuss  the  possible  links  between  local  magnetite  skarn  formation 
and regional orogenic gold mineralisation in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier. || The  F2  folds  are  associated  with  a  015º/75ºE  (e.g. Sadiola Hill, Tambali, Alamoutala) to 035º/75ºE (e.g. FE3, FE4) axial-planar cleavage 
(S2)  indicative  of  a  WNW  fold  vergence. Fold  axes  and  intersection  lineations  plunge 
gently (15-30°) to the SSW or NNE. A number of NNE-trending thrusts and high-angle 
reverse  faults  are  closely  associated  with  these  F2  folds. Fold  and  fault  geometry,  and 
lineation  data  associated  with  this  second  deformation  event  (D2s)  are  consistent  with 
NW-SE directed shortening. || The data presented in 
this study suggest that the Alamoutala deposit contains an early and locally-developed 
magnetite-bearing skarn that was overprinted by regional orogenic gold mineralization. This  interpretation  is  supported  by  micro-textural  evidence  that  indicates  that  the  ore-
forming  process  must  have  taken  place,  at  least  in  part,  after  the  solidification  and 
cooling  of  the  pluton  because  shearing  generated  mineralized  proto-mylonite  zones  in 
the quartz-feldspar-porphyry stocks. Moreover, the bulk of the ore is shear-hosted and 
displays  no  vertical  or  lateral  zonation  of  metals  away  from  the  intrusive  contact  as 
commonly observed in magmatic-hydrothermal systems (e.g., Au-skarn, Meinert et al., 
2005; Cu-Au porphyry, Seedorff et al., 2005). It is likely that magmas, which exsolved 
a  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluid,  and  the  regional  gold-bearing  fluids  have  utilized  the 
same  fault  system  at  Alamoutala,  although  at  different  times. Ore  fluids  were  most 
likely  concentrated  in  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  the  quartz-feldspar-porphyry 
stocks and in damage zones surrounding fault intersections. Nevertheless, the difficulty 
in  interpreting  the  Alamoutala  deposit  is  to  reconcile  the  thermal  disequilibrium 
between  country  rocks  at  regional  greenschist-facies  conditions  and  the  higher 
temperature  of  the  ore-related  hydrothermal  alteration  paragenesis  with  characteristics 
of orogenic gold deposits (e.g., Groves et al., 1998, 2003; Goldfarb et al., 2005). || metaluminous  plutons  (e.g.,  diorite,  hornblende-biotite-granodiorite)  to  ca  2080-2060 
Ma peraluminous biotite-monzogranites. The  tectonic,  magmatic,  metamorphic  and  hydrothermal  alteration  history  of  the  gold 
deposits in the district is comparable to that of other world-class orogenic gold deposits 
in the KKI. Despite the commonalities, gold mineralisation in the Sadiola-Yatela district 
exhibits  three  distinct  styles  defined  on  the  basis  of  contrasted  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis. The  three gold mineralisation styles  are typified by  the Sadiola Hill-style 
Au-As-Sb  mineralisation,  the  Alamoutala-style  Au-Cu  mineralisation,  and  the  Yatela-
style  auriferous  residuum. The  metal  enrichment  association  and  geothermometric 
estimates from ore and alteration paragenesis at Sadiola Hill are compatible with those 
of mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-
300°C)  orogenic  gold  deposits  worldwide. The  Alamoutala  deposit  represents  two 
distinct  hydrothermal  systems  in  which  a  magnetite-bearing  skarn  developed  locally 
surrounding  syn-kinematic  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks,  and  was  overprinted  by 
district-wide orogenic gold mineralisation. || undoubtedly  responsible  for  the  formation  of  map-scale  structures. Syn-tectonic 
magmatic suites with arc-related geochemical signatures have been described to intrude 
the KKI volcano-sedimentary country rocks between ca. 2115 and 2070 Ma (Hirdes and 
Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006;  Gueye  et  al.,  2007, 
2008). The REE signature and calc-alkaline affinity of the Alamoutala quartz-feldspar-
porphyry stocks are consistent with data reported for other Eburnean granitoids of the 
Falémé belt (e.g., Schwartz and Melcher, 2004; Dioh et al., 2006; Lambert-Smith, 2014) 
and  suggests  derivation  from  either  a  metasomatized  mantle  source  with  crustal 
contamination  (e.g.,  Egal  et  al.,  2002)  or  melting  of  an  enriched  lower-crustal  garnet-
amphibolite source (e.g., Doumbia et al., 1998; Pouclet et al., 2006). It is possible that 
the late Eburnean magmatic activity helped generate increased thermal gradients, which 
could have produced regional fluid systems capable of transporting gold (e.g., Oberthür 
et al., 1998). Additional geochronology and metamorphic data for the KKI will help to 
better understand the tectono-thermal evolution of the inlier.",Alamoutala,llm

with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et

as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared

during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that

The Alamoutala deposit is situated within the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier (KKI), 
which  represents  the  westernmost  exposure  (approx. || deposit (Masurel et al., in press) and is suggested to represent a transient thermal effect

and tectonics 
 At  least  two  phases  of  folding  have  affected  country  rocks  at  the  Alamoutala 
gold deposit. The D1y early event may be correlated with the regional D1 responsible for 
the  formation  of  a  NNW-trending  structural  corridor  in  Mali  and  associated  WSW-
ENE-directed  shortening  (public  data  from  AMIRA  International,  West  African 
Initiative final report, 2013). The D1 deformation episode has been interpreted to have 
occurred between ca. || strike/dip/quadrant  and  linear data  are  given  as  plunge  and azimuth. In  this  paper,  the 
“y” subscript indicates that the considered structural event is only valid for the Yatela 
district,  which  may  differ  from  regional  structural  compilations  reported  for  the  West 
African  Craton. The  trends  of  ore  shoots  in  and  surrounding  the  main  orebody  of  the 
Alamoutala deposit were evaluated using Leapfrog® three-dimensional rendering of the

Recent  research  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the  spatial 
association between calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron 
skarn  mineralization,  suggesting  a  complex  fluid  evolution  in  relation  to  the 
development of major gold deposits (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2013a, b). The emplacement 
of Eburnean quartz-feldspar-porphyry stocks in the Alamoutala deposit area resulted in 
the  formation  of  a  low  P-high  T  magnetite-bearing  skarn  in  a  geological  setting 
analogous  to  that  of  the  Falémé  iron  skarns  (e.g.,  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The 
gold  mineralization  is  shear-hosted  and  occured  subsequently  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent 
tectonics,  and 
thus  overprints

7.1. Towards a genetic model for the Alamoutala gold deposit 
The  geological  setting  of  the  Alamoutala  gold  deposit  is  analogous  to  that  of 
magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  iron  district  as  described  in  Schwartz  and  Melcher 
(2004). The  mineralogy,  whole  rock  geochemistry,  and  emplacement  age  of  the 
Alamoutala  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  bodies  are  consistent  with  that  of  the  Falémé 
plutons  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The  silicate  and 
oxide mineral association of endoskarn and exoskarn at Alamoutala indicates an overall 
oxidized  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluid  (e.g.,  formation  of  Fe3+-bearing  andradite, 
relative  abundance  of  magnetite,  garnet  >>  pyroxene)  and  a  shallow  crustal  level  of 
emplacement  (≤5  km)  (e.g.,  Meinert,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). The  Alamoutala 
magnetite skarns, however, have never been of economic interest. || The deposit therefore provides an ideal setting to investigate field relationships between 
magnetite  skarn  formation  and  gold  mineralization  in  the  region. Although  initial 
attempts  to  date  the  gold  mineralization  in-situ  have  failed,  this  study  outlines  the 
geology,  tectonic  setting,  contact  metamorphism,  absolute  timing,  and  whole  rock 
geochemistry of the local intrusive stocks, hydrothermal alteration, and ore mineralogy 
in  the  area  of  the  Alamoutala  gold  deposit. The  primary  conclusion  is  that  the 
Alamoutala  deposit  represents  a  locally-developed  magnetite-bearing  skarn  in  the 
aureole  to  the  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  that  was  overprinted  by  a  regional 
orogenic gold event in the late Eburnean. 3. Geological setting

The  Alamoutala  gold  deposit  is  located  in  the  Kédougou-Kénieba  inlier,  a 
window  of  Paleoproterozoic  rocks  that  outcrop  in  eastern  Senegal  and  western  Mali. The  deposit  is  part  of  the  ~3  Moz  Au  Yatela  district  and  produced  308,400  oz  Au 
between  2002  and  2012. Country  rocks  in  the  Alamoutala  open  pit  consist  of 
limestones, arenites, wackes, and siltstones. || Detail  detection  limits 
achieved for each analysis are provided in the supplementary material. 5.4. Geochronology  
Intermediate  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  that  outcrop  on  walls  of  the 
Alamoutala  open  pit  have  been  dated  in  order  to  compare  the  timing  of  magma 
emplacement and formation of the magnetite-bearing skarn aureole with those events in 
the Falémé iron district. Approximately 5 kg of rock was collected from outcrop for U-
Pb geochronology. After cleaning and removal of weathered surfaces, the rock sample 
was  processed  at  Geotrack  Pty. Ltd.",Alamoutala open pit,llm

provides  a  new  appreciation  for  the  economic  interest  of  Yatela-style  orebodies  and 
their prospectivity in other gold provinces of the West African Craton where carbonates 
are  present,  such  as  in  the  Siguiri  basin  in  Guinea  and  the  Ity  region  in  western  Côte 
d’Ivoire. 2. Introduction 
The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West 
African Craton (e.g., Ashanti, Morila) (Oberthür et al., 1998; Allibone et al., 2002a, b; 
Feybesse et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2011; Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). || The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone acted as the main conduit 
for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa, 
Sadiola  Hill)  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of  West 
Africa  occurred  over  a  protracted  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics,  soon  after  the 
cessation of regional-scale contractional deformation. Despite the uncertainty regarding 
the  source  of  fluids  and  metals  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  hydrothermal  system,  the  late-
Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  activity  reflects  a  transient  geodynamic  process  that  may 
have been critical for orogenic gold mineralization in the region. 60",Ashanti,llm

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted

intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links 
between  gold  mineralization  and  magnetite  skarn  development  in  the  region  (e.g.,

1. Preamble and knowledge gaps 
Paleoproterozoic  (i.e. Birimian)  volcano-plutonic  belts  and  sedimentary  basins 
of  West  Africa  not  only  provide  a  complete  record  of  crustal  growth  but  also  host  a 
number of world-class  gold  deposits  (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher  et al., 1992). To 
date, a large number of studies have focused on the Baoulé-Mossi domain, which covers 
portions  of  Burkina  Faso,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Ghana,  Guinea  and  Mali  (Fig. 1). || Gold 
deposits  of  various  types  have  been  recognised  in  these  Birimian  belts  and  include 
orogenic  gold  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b),  intrusion-related  gold  (e.g., 
Morila, McFarlane et al., 2011; Hammond et al., 2011), Cu-Au porphyry (e.g., Gaoua, 
public data from AMIRA International West African Initiative final report, 2013), and 
paleoplacer  (e.g.,  Tarkwa,  Pigois  et  al.,  2003). Detailed  deposit-scale  studies,  which 
integrated  structural-metamorphic-hydrothermal  data  with  high  precision  isotopic 
dating,  have  also  shown  evidence  for  distinct  gold  mineralisation  pulses  (e.g.,  2191-
2158 Ma gold at Wassa, Parra-Avila, in press; 2105 ± 2 Ma gold at Ashanti, Oberthür et 
al.,  1998;  2063  ±  9  Ma  gold  at  Damang,  Pigois  et  al.,  2003). Nevertheless,  the  vast 
majority  of  world-class  gold  deposits  in  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  belong  to  the 
orogenic  class  (e.g.,  Groves  et  al.,  1998;  Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003; 
Goldfarb et al., 2005) and have been related to geological processes associated with the 
Eburnean  orogeny  dated  between  2115  and  2060  Ma  (e.g.,  Feybesse  et  al.,  2006; 
Lawrence et al., 2013; Fougerouse et al., in press; Lebrun et al., in press). A number of 
studies have been carried out elsewhere, in the Archean Kénéma-Man domain and the 
Kédougou-Kénieba  inlier  (Fig. 1),  but  have  been  limited  by  disjointed  political  and 
geographic landscapes, volatile social context, and the recent Ebola outbreak. The KKI represents the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Birimian crust 
in the West African Craton and has received increased attention from both the industry 
and  academia  as  it  represents  an  emerging  world-class  gold  province. || The  polycyclic  deformation  recorded  in  sedimentary  and  magmatic 
rocks of the region includes a period of early convergence (D1s), followed by a period of 
fold-and-thrust tectonics (D2s), and later transcurrent tectonics (D3s-D4s). The bulk of the 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occured  during  D3s,  with  sinistral  displacement  and 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  steep  NNE-
trending shear zones connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. The  results  of  this  study,  when  integrated  with  published  data,  indicate  that  the  late 
Eburnean  tectono-thermal  event  between  2080  and  2060  Ma  represented  the 
geodynamic  engine  that  empowered  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Kédougou-
Kénieba  inlier. The  new  data  also  further  supports  the  hypothesis  that  the  Eburnean 
tectono-magmatic activity affected the Baoulé-Mossi domain diachronously from SE to 
NW. 2. Introduction

syn-deformational foreland basins. Rocks of the sedimentary basins and volcanic belts 
were intruded by different generations of syn-tectonic, calc-alkaline plutons during the 
Eburnean  orogeny  between  ca. 2115  and  2070  Ma. These  granitoids  include 
metaluminous hornblende-biotite-bearing diorite to granodiorite (e.g., Mamakono, 2076

bearing granodiorite-tonalite (e.g., Boboti, 2080 ± 1 Ma, Hirdes and Davis, 2002), and 
peraluminous monzogranites (e.g., Saraya, 2079 ± 2 Ma, Hirdes and Davis, 2002) (Fig. 1). Available  geochronological  data  suggest  that  the  emplacement  of  most  Eburnean 
granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. || 2090 and 2070 Ma, after 
the cessation of regional compressional deformation (Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et 
al., 2014; Masurel et al., in press). The KKI also hosts iron skarn deposits of the Falémé 
district, which collectively represent the largest Birimian iron resource of West Africa 
(750  Mt  ore  reserves,  ArcellorMittal  2007,  press  release)  (Fig. 1). The  iron  skarns 
formed  post-peak  metamorphism  at  ca. 2080  Ma  and  are  spatially  and  genetically 
associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons,  such  as  the  Balangouma  monzodiorite  and  the

Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Lambert-Smith,  2014). Recent 
research in the eastern part of the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between 
calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron skarn mineralization, 
suggesting  the  potential  role  of  a  complex  fluid  history  in  the  development  of  major 
gold deposits (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a,b). || Available  geochronological  data  suggest  that  the 
emplacement of most granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. 2115

gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela region and other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014) suggests that gold mineralisation 
occurred  subsequently  during  a  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics  that  outlasted 
emplacement  of  the  peraluminous  high-K  granites,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional  deformation. It  is  likely  that  the  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity 
participated  in  the  generation  of  thermal  gradients,  which  produced  regional  fluid 
systems  capable  of  transpoting  gold  (e.g.,  Masurel  et  al.,  a,  b). || Geochronological data acquired on a rhyolite flow provides a magmatic age of 2099 ± 4

Paleoproterozoic  (i.e. Birimian)  volcano-plutonic  belts  and  sedimentary  basins 
of  West  Africa  not  only  provide  a  complete  record  of  crustal  growth  but  also  host  a 
number of world-class  gold  deposits  (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher  et al., 1992). To 
date, a large number of studies have focused on the Baoulé-Mossi domain, which covers 
portions  of  Burkina  Faso,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Ghana,  Guinea  and  Mali  (Fig. 1). || Detrital zircons in the Loulo area have been dated between 2156 ± 10 Ma 
and  2125  ±  8  Ma  (Calvez  et  al.,  1990;  Pb-Pb  zircon). The  peraluminous  Gamaye 
leucogranite that intruded the Kofi sediments has been dated at 2045 ± 27 Ma (Bassot 
and Caen-Vachette, 1984; Rb-Sr on whole rock). Birimian rocks of the KKI have undergone polycyclic deformation. Early phases 
of fold-and-thrust tectonics (D1-D2) linked to initial accretion are followed by a period 
of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa, 
2010, 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). A similar 
polyphase character has been reported in other Birimian terranes of West Africa (e.g., in 
Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,  Hein,  2010;  in

sequence is constrained to 2103 ± 14 - 2094 ± 4 Ma (Amstrong, 2003; McFarlane et al., 
2011). The D3s event marks a switch from dominantly pure shear (folding and reverse 
faulting  with  minor  strike-slip  displacement  during  D2s)  to  a  simple-shear  (strike-slip 
faulting) system (Fig. 12). || The development of NNE-trending upright folds 
(F2)  and  penetrative  axial-planar  cleavage  (S2)  is  cryptic  at  Yatela  but  represents  the 
dominant structural feature 1.5 km west in the KW18 ancillary pits and 25 km south at 
the world-class Sadiola Hill gold deposit. Fold geometry and lineation data associated 
with  the  second  deformation  event  (D2y)  are  consistent  with  NW-SE  directed 
shortening. The  D2y  event  is  compatible  with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics

transcurrent tectonics, after  the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. The  best  age  estimate  for  region-wide  world-class  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the 
Ashanti  belt,  however,  is  constrained  to  2105  ±  2  Ma  (Oberthür  et  al.,  1998). By

Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || Combined  channel  sampling  and  three-dimensional  rendering  of  the  assay

Alamoutala Fracture Zone, and FE4 Shear Zone) applied a direct control on ore shoot 
geometries in the Sadiola Hill, Alamoutala, FE3, and FE4 gold deposits (Fig. 4E-F). A very late deformation episode (D4s) is associated with a dextral reactivation of earlier 
accretionary  structures. Chlorite-calcite  slickenfibres  on  rare  fault  walls  from  the 
Sadiola  Hill  and Alamoutala  open pits indicate late dextral displacement. Steep NNE-
trending  faults  associated  with  dextral  displacement  have  been  mapped  locally  in

observed in the Sadiola Hill and FE3 open pits. In contrast, there is a lack of evidence 
for stromatolitic facies in carbonates of the region, which would reflect shallow water 
conditions. Thus, the deposition of thick carbonate sequences probably occurred in the 
slope and plain of a syn-deformational basin in a convergent setting. Sedimentary rock

7.1. Towards a genetic model for the Alamoutala gold deposit

magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  iron  district  as  described  in  Schwartz  and  Melcher 
(2004). The  mineralogy,  whole  rock  geochemistry,  and  emplacement  age  of  the 
Alamoutala  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  bodies  are  consistent  with  that  of  the  Falémé 
plutons  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The  silicate  and 
oxide mineral association of endoskarn and exoskarn at Alamoutala indicates an overall 
oxidized  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluid  (e.g.,  formation  of  Fe3+-bearing  andradite, 
relative  abundance  of  magnetite,  garnet  >>  pyroxene)  and  a  shallow  crustal  level  of 
emplacement  (≤5  km)  (e.g.,  Meinert,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). The  Alamoutala 
magnetite skarns, however, have never been of economic interest. || Figure  8. A)  Representative  chemical  composition  of  pyroxenes  analysed  by  electron  probe. The

The Alamoutala gold deposit is located in the Yatela mining district. The district 
displays  widespread  evidence  of  ancient  and  recent  artisanal  mining,  with  written 
records  of  mining  dating  back  more  than  250  years  (public  data  from  IAMGold

prospects, followed by trench sampling in 1996. Drill testing resulted in the discovery 
of  a  significant  gold  resource  at  Yatela  and  a  minor  one  at  Alamoutala. Disseminated 
magnetite  is  abundant  in  host  rocks  at  Alamoutala  but  has  never  been  of  economic 
interest  in  contrast  to  the  magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  district  (see  Fig. || Available  geochronological  data  suggest  that  the 
emplacement of most granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. 2115 
and 2060 Ma, which is the best time estimate for the Eburnean orogeny in the KKI. The 
iron skarns of the Falémé district formed post-peak metamorphism at ca. 2080 Ma and 
are  spatially  and  genetically  associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons  such  as  the

granodiorite  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Lambert-Smith, 2014). The similar relative timing and structural setting between 
gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela region and other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014) suggests that gold mineralisation 
occurred  subsequently  during  a  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics  that  outlasted 
emplacement  of  the  peraluminous  high-K  granites,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional  deformation. It  is  likely  that  the  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity 
participated  in  the  generation  of  thermal  gradients,  which  produced  regional  fluid 
systems  capable  of  transpoting  gold  (e.g.,  Masurel  et  al.,  a,  b). || The  Falémé  belt  (Fig. 1)  consists  of  calc-alkaline  volcaniclastic  rocks,  wackes,  chert,

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted 
from hydrothermal systems that sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and 
magmatic reservoirs. Such diversity appears to be largely controlled by the distance of 
the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links 
between  gold  mineralization  and  magnetite  skarn  development  in  the  region  (e.g.,

MTZ  and  is  related  to  a  magmatic  fluid  derived  from  syn-kinematic  quartz-feldspar-
porphyry  sills. The  goal  of  this  contribution  is  to  summarize  the  geology,  tectonic

7.1. Towards a genetic model for the Alamoutala gold deposit 
The  geological  setting  of  the  Alamoutala  gold  deposit  is  analogous  to  that  of 
magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  iron  district  as  described  in  Schwartz  and  Melcher 
(2004). The  mineralogy,  whole  rock  geochemistry,  and  emplacement  age  of  the 
Alamoutala  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  bodies  are  consistent  with  that  of  the  Falémé 
plutons  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The  silicate  and 
oxide mineral association of endoskarn and exoskarn at Alamoutala indicates an overall 
oxidized  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluid  (e.g.,  formation  of  Fe3+-bearing  andradite, 
relative  abundance  of  magnetite,  garnet  >>  pyroxene)  and  a  shallow  crustal  level  of 
emplacement  (≤5  km)  (e.g.,  Meinert,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). The  Alamoutala 
magnetite skarns, however, have never been of economic interest. || Detail  detection  limits

Intermediate  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  that  outcrop  on  walls  of  the 
Alamoutala  open  pit  have  been  dated  in  order  to  compare  the  timing  of  magma 
emplacement and formation of the magnetite-bearing skarn aureole with those events in 
the Falémé iron district. Approximately 5 kg of rock was collected from outcrop for U-

Recent  research  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the  spatial 
association between calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron 
skarn  mineralization,  suggesting  a  complex  fluid  evolution  in  relation  to  the 
development of major gold deposits (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2013a, b). The emplacement 
of Eburnean quartz-feldspar-porphyry stocks in the Alamoutala deposit area resulted in 
the  formation  of  a  low  P-high  T  magnetite-bearing  skarn  in  a  geological  setting 
analogous  to  that  of  the  Falémé  iron  skarns  (e.g.,  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The 
gold  mineralization  is  shear-hosted  and  occured  subsequently  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent 
tectonics,  and 
thus  overprints 
the  contact-metamorphic  mineral 
assemblages. The current study indicates that the magmatic episode occurred at 2083 ± 
7 Ma, and thus regional orogenic gold mineralization is younger than this age. 119",Faleme iron skarns,llm

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted

the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the

The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold

the 
westernmost  exposure  of  Paleoproterozoic  crust  in  the  West  African  Craton,  with 
outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent

Paleoproterozoic  (i.e. Birimian)  volcano-plutonic  belts  and  sedimentary  basins 
of  West  Africa  not  only  provide  a  complete  record  of  crustal  growth  but  also  host  a

date, a large number of studies have focused on the Baoulé-Mossi domain, which covers 
portions  of  Burkina  Faso,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Ghana,  Guinea  and  Mali  (Fig. 1). || Detrital zircons in the Loulo area have been dated between 2156 ± 10 Ma 
and  2125  ±  8  Ma  (Calvez  et  al.,  1990;  Pb-Pb  zircon). The  peraluminous  Gamaye 
leucogranite that intruded the Kofi sediments has been dated at 2045 ± 27 Ma (Bassot 
and Caen-Vachette, 1984; Rb-Sr on whole rock). Birimian rocks of the KKI have undergone polycyclic deformation. Early phases 
of fold-and-thrust tectonics (D1-D2) linked to initial accretion are followed by a period 
of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa, 
2010, 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). A similar 
polyphase character has been reported in other Birimian terranes of West Africa (e.g., in 
Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,  Hein,  2010;  in 
Guinea,  Lahondère  et  al.,  2002;  in  southern  Mali,  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011;  in  southern 
Ghana, Feybesse et al., 2006; in Burkina Faso, Baratoux et al., 2011). The SMSZ and 
MTZ have been interpreted to represent major transpressional faults initiated during D2 
(Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). || The development of NNE-
trending upright folds and penetrative axial-planar cleavage (S2) are correlated with the 
D2s  deformation  event. Fold  and  fault  geometries,  and  kinematic  indicators  are 
consistent  with  NW-SE-directed  shortening. At  the  regional  scale,  D2s  is  compatible 
with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics  correlated  with  a  region-wide  compressive 
event  (D2)  (in  Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,

al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al.,  2014). In  southern  Mali,  inversion  of  the  Birimian  host 
sequence is constrained to 2103 ± 14 - 2094 ± 4 Ma (Amstrong, 2003; McFarlane et al., 
2011). The D3s event marks a switch from dominantly pure shear (folding and reverse 
faulting  with  minor  strike-slip  displacement  during  D2s)  to  a  simple-shear  (strike-slip 
faulting) system (Fig. 12). || The development of NNE-trending upright folds 
(F2)  and  penetrative  axial-planar  cleavage  (S2)  is  cryptic  at  Yatela  but  represents  the 
dominant structural feature 1.5 km west in the KW18 ancillary pits and 25 km south at 
the world-class Sadiola Hill gold deposit. Fold geometry and lineation data associated 
with  the  second  deformation  event  (D2y)  are  consistent  with  NW-SE  directed 
shortening. The  D2y  event  is  compatible  with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics 
responsible  for  the  region-wide  structural  grain  (D2)  (in  Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,

The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West 
African Craton (e.g., Ashanti, Morila) (Oberthür et al., 1998; Allibone et al., 2002a, b;

and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; McFarlane et al., 2011; in the 
KKI,  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || Detrital zircons in the Loulo area have been dated between 2156 ± 10 Ma 
and  2125  ±  8  Ma  (Calvez  et  al.,  1990;  Pb-Pb  zircon). The  peraluminous  Gamaye 
leucogranite that intruded the Kofi sediments has been dated at 2045 ± 27 Ma (Bassot 
and Caen-Vachette, 1984; Rb-Sr on whole rock). Birimian rocks of the KKI have undergone polycyclic deformation. Early phases 
of fold-and-thrust tectonics (D1-D2) linked to initial accretion are followed by a period 
of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa, 
2010, 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). A similar 
polyphase character has been reported in other Birimian terranes of West Africa (e.g., in 
Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,  Hein,  2010;  in

Ghana, Feybesse et al., 2006; in Burkina Faso, Baratoux et al., 2011). The SMSZ and 
MTZ have been interpreted to represent major transpressional faults initiated during D2

trending upright folds and penetrative axial-planar cleavage (S2) are correlated with the 
D2s  deformation  event. Fold  and  fault  geometries,  and  kinematic  indicators  are 
consistent  with  NW-SE-directed  shortening. At  the  regional  scale,  D2s  is  compatible 
with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics  correlated  with  a  region-wide  compressive 
event  (D2)  (in  Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,

al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al.,  2014). In  southern  Mali,  inversion  of  the  Birimian  host 
sequence is constrained to 2103 ± 14 - 2094 ± 4 Ma (Amstrong, 2003; McFarlane et al., 
2011). The D3s event marks a switch from dominantly pure shear (folding and reverse 
faulting  with  minor  strike-slip  displacement  during  D2s)  to  a  simple-shear  (strike-slip 
faulting) system (Fig. 12). || The development of NNE-trending upright folds

dominant structural feature 1.5 km west in the KW18 ancillary pits and 25 km south at 
the world-class Sadiola Hill gold deposit. Fold geometry and lineation data associated 
with  the  second  deformation  event  (D2y)  are  consistent  with  NW-SE  directed 
shortening. The  D2y  event  is  compatible  with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics

2006). The Yatela diorite was emplaced during D2y and has been dated at 2106 ± 10 Ma 
by  Hein  et  al. || The polycyclic 
deformation  history  recorded  in  the  KKI  is  similar  to  that  reported  at  the  scale  of  the 
West African Craton (In Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et al., 2009; in Burkina

et al., 2011; in southern Ghana, Allibone et al., 2002a, b). As for the KKI, the bulk of 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent tectonics, after  the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. The  best  age  estimate  for  region-wide  world-class  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the 
Ashanti  belt,  however,  is  constrained  to  2105  ±  2  Ma  (Oberthür  et  al.,  1998). By 
comparison, regional orogenic gold mineralisation is younger in the KKI and is better 
correlated with the 2063 ± 9 Ma minor gold phase reported in the Damang area (Pigois 
et al., 2003) or the 2074 ± 14 Ma gold phase at Morila in southern Mali (McFarlane et 
al., 2011). Regional peak metamorphism was dated at ca. 2100 Ma in the Ashanti belt of 
southern Ghana (Oberthür et al., 1998) whereas metamorphic monazite and titanite from

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted 
from hydrothermal systems that sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and 
magmatic reservoirs. Such diversity appears to be largely controlled by the distance of 
the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links 
between  gold  mineralization  and  magnetite  skarn  development  in  the  region  (e.g., 
Falémé  iron  district). The  shear-hosted  Massawa  deposit  occurs  within  3  km  of  the 
MTZ  and  is  related  to  a  magmatic  fluid  derived  from  syn-kinematic  quartz-feldspar-
porphyry  sills. The  goal  of  this  contribution  is  to  summarize  the  geology,  tectonic 
setting, hydrothermal alteration, and ore mineralogy of the Sadiola Hill gold deposit in 
an attempt to clarify its genesis. || (Lawrence et al., 2013a; Masurel et al., in press). The Dialé-Daléma and Kofi have been 
interpreted  to  represent  syn-deformational  foreland  basins  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002; Gueye et al., 2008). Four deformation episodes have been identified in the KKI 
and include early thrusting events associated with crustal thickening (D1-D2), followed 
by  two  transcurrent  events  (D3-D4)  accomodating  oblique  convergence  (Ledru  et  al., 
1991;  Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010,  2011;  Diene  et  al.,  2012). Little  is 
known  about  the  earliest  event  (D1)  due  to  pervasive  reworking  by  subsquent 
deformation. The D2 and D3 events mark the principal imprint of the Eburnean orogeny 
(ca. 2115-2050 Ma) in the eastern part of the KKI and are undoubtedly responsible for 
the formation of map-scale structures (Lawrence et al., 2013a; Masurel et al., in press). || 1.5. Gold mineralisation 
Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || 2.25 to 2.05 
Ga. The geology of the KKI consists of linear greenstone belts and wider sedimentary 
basins. Available geochronological data indicate that distinct peaks of magmatic activity 
occurred in the region from ca. 2200 Ma to 2070 Ma (e.g., Boher et al., 1992; Dia et al., 
1997; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye et al., 2007, 
2008). Intensive  studies  of  the  Eburnean  granitoids  have  focused  on  the  western  and 
southern parts of the KKI but limited data exist for the eastern part of the inlier, which 
hosts  the  world-class  Loulo  and  Sadiola-Yatela  gold  districts. Hence,  the  study  of 
igneous  rocks  in  that  exceptionally  gold-endowed  region  appears  critical  not  only  to 
unravel  the  tectono-thermal  evolution  of  the  KKI  crust  but  also  in  terms  of  mineral 
system,  whereby  gold  deposits  are  viewed  as  local  expressions  of  orogen-  to 
172 || 2115 and 2060 Ma, which is the best time 
estimate  for  the  Eburnean  orogeny  in  the  KKI. The  evolution  from  calc-alkaline 
metaluminous  hornblende-granodiorite  plutons  (ca. 2120-2080  Ma) 
to  evolved 
peraluminous  monzogranites  (ca. 2080-2060  Ma)  is  similar  to  that  reported  for 
Eburnean  granitoids  elsewhere  in  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Dioh  et  al., 
2006; Gueye et al., 2008). The Sadiola volcanic rocks formed at 2118 ± 9 Ma and are 
significantly  younger  than  bimodal  volcanic  rocks  in  the  Mako  belt  (dated  between 
2195 ± 11 and 2158 ± 8 Ma, Dia, 1988, Dia et al., 1997). The 2071 ± 5 Ma and 2066 ± 
8  Ma  ages  for  magmatic  crystallisation  of  the  peraluminous  biotite-granites  in  the 
Sadiola Hill deposit area are the youngest plutonic ages so far reported from the Baoulé-
Mossi  domain. || 2160 and 2115 Ma (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo 
and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; McFarlane et al., 2011; in the 
KKI,  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || 3. Future work 
Despite  the  work  undertaken  by  the  candidate,  a  number  of  questions  remain 
unanswered, some of which are directly relevant to exploration targeting:  
3.1. Source of fluids and metals 
Recent  research  suggests  that  the  diversity  in  mineralisation  styles  and  ore 
paragenesis  expressed  in  the  KKI  result  from  a  dynamic  hydrothermal  system  that 
sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and magmatic reservoirs (Lawrence 
et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014). The collection and interpretation of fluid inclusion 
and  stable  isotope  data  is  critical  to  establishing  an  ore  genetic  model  for  the  gold 
deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela district. It would also be interesting to see how well the 
orogenic gold paradigm (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2003; 
Goldfarb et al., 2005) translate to accretionary terranes of the West African Craton. 3.2. || 6.4. Comparison with other Birimian terranes and diachroneity of 
geological development 
The  ca. 2110-2070  Ma  volcanic  rocks  exposed  in  the  KKI  are  younger  than 
volcanic rocks in the Baoulé-Mossi domain. Thus far, ca. 2100 Ma volcanic ages have 
only  been  reported  in  Côte  d’Ivoire  (Fétékro  belt,  Leake,  1992;  Ouango  Fitini  belt, 
Hirdes  et  al.,  1996). In  addition,  the  2071  ±  5  Ma  and  2066  ±  8  Ma  magmatic 
crystallisation  ages  of  the  peraluminous  biotite-granites  in  the  Kofi  basin  are  the 
youngest plutonic ages so far reported from the Baoulé-Mossi domain. || Fold and fault geometries, and kinematic 
indicators  are  consistent  with  progressive  NW-SE-directed  shortening. The  following 
D3  event  is  associated  with  the  strike-slip  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures 
and  the  formation  of  steep  NNE-trending  sinistral  shear  zones  (Diene  et  al.,  2012; 
Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  a,  b). Fault  geometries  and  kinematic 
indicators  are  consistent  with  NNW-SSE-directed  shortening. The  D2  and  D3  events 
documented  in  the  KKI  relate  to  the  evolution  of  a  regional  system  accommodating 
oblique  convergence  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  a). The 
Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  the  Main  Transcurrent  Zone  are  interpreted  to  have 
formed during the onset of D2 as transpressional shear zones (Fig. 1) (Lawrence et al., 
2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). || Post-Birimian dolerite dykes 
Dolerite  dykes  are  abundant  across  the  West  African  craton  and  present  as 
magnetic  linear  features  due  to  their  remanent  magnetism  and  high  magnetic 
susceptibility  (Perrouty  et  al.,  2012). Two  sets  of  dolerite  dyke  swarms  have  been 
reported  in  the  KKI  and  consistently  present  as  ENE-WSW  and  NE-SW-oriented 
lineaments. Both  dyke  sets  crosscut  the  Paleoproterozoic  basement  and  show  no 
evidence  for  deformation  and  hydrothermal  alteration. These  dolerite  swarms  can  be 
correlated  with  the  several  generations  of  Mesoproterozoic  to  Neoproterozoic  dolerite 
swarms  recorded  in  eastern  Senegal  and  dated  at  1500  Ma,  1300  Ma  and  1150  Ma 
(Kalsbeek et al., 2008; Perrouty et al., 2012). 4. Methodology 
4.1. || Recent  discoveries  in  the  inlier  include  the 
Fekola  gold  deposit  (3.72  Moz  probable  mineral  reserves,  B2Gold  press  release,  July 
2015) and the Petowal gold deposit (mineral resource of 1.35 Moz contained Au, public 
data  from  ToroGold  website,  2015). Recent  research  in  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the 
spatial  association  between  calc-alkaline  Eburnean  plutons,  gold  mineralisation,  and 
local iron skarn mineralisation, suggesting the potential role of a complex fluid history 
in  the  development  of  major  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a,  b; 
Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Falémé, Lambert-Smith, 2014). 2 || Regional geology 
The  geology  of  the  KKI  consists  of  linear  volcano-plutonic  belts  and 
sedimentary basins, which are separated by the Main Transcurrent Zone (MTZ, Ledru et 
al.,  1991)  and  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  (SMSZ,  Bassot  and  Dommanget,  1986) 
(Fig. 1). It differs from other Paleoproterozoic terranes by the abundance of carbonates, 
with  thick  sequences  (>250  m)  in  the  Dialé-Daléma  and  Kofi  Series  representing  the 
most extensive carbonate exposure in the Birimian of West Africa (Fig. 1) (Bosse et al., 
1996;  Bering  et  al.,  1998). Rocks  of  the  Dialé-Daléma  Series  (Fig. 1)  include 
volcaniclastics,  arenites,  wackes,  siltstones,  argillites,  and  carbonates  with  minor 
intercalations  of  andesite  lavas  and  rhyolite  pyroclastites  (Bassot,  1987;  Dia,  1988; 
Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002). || Table 1. Compilation of available geochronological data for the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier 
3.3. Tectonics   
  Rocks  in  the  KKI  have  undergone  polycyclic  deformation. A  summary  table 
presenting structural events reported for different regions of the KKI is given in Table 2. Most  authors  report  an  early  period  of  thrusting  tectonics  responsible  for  crustal 
thickening  (D1-  D2)  followed  by  a  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics  accommodating 
oblique convergence (D3-D4) (Diene et al., 2012). The early deformation episode (D1) 
was reported in the Mako belt where it is correlated with stratigraphic stacking and the 
formation of a NNW-trending planar fabric (Dabo and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; Gueye et al., 
2008; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Masurel et al., in press a, b, c). || The  Yatela  gold  deposit  is  unique  with  respect  to  mineralisation  types 
encountered  in  West  Africa  because  an  auriferous  residuum  of  economic  interest  (>1 
Moz)  derives  from  an  underlying  sub-economic  Birimian  occurrence. This  study 
provides  a  new  appreciation  for  the  economic  interest  of  Yatela-style  orebodies  and 
their prospectivity in other gold provinces of the West African Craton where carbonates 
are  present,  such  as  in  the  Siguiri  basin  in  Guinea  and  the  Ity  region  in  western  Côte 
d’Ivoire. 2. Introduction 
The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West 
African Craton (e.g., Ashanti, Morila) (Oberthür et al., 1998; Allibone et al., 2002a, b; 
Feybesse et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2011; Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). || The  geology  of  the  KKI  differs  from  other  Paleoproterozoic  granite-greenstone 
belts and sedimentary basins by the abundance of carbonate rocks. The Yatela deposit 
occurs within 8 km of the regional-scale Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. Country rocks in the 
Yatela region have been subjected to polycyclic deformation and regional greenschist-
facies metamorphism. A syn-kinematic diorite stock has intruded the metasedimentary 
sequences in the open pit and is associated with a hornblende-hornfels contact aureole. Field relationships and micro-textural data indicate that the primary gold mineralisation 
is  shear-hosted. The  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  Yatela 
primary  gold  mineralisation  and  other  world-class  deposits  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al.,  2014; Sadiola  Hill, Masurel et al., in 
131 || The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurred  during  D3y  based  on  field  relationships  and 
micro-textural observations. The equivalent structural setting and relative timing of gold 
between Yatela and other world-class gold deposits in the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence 
et  al.,  2013a;  Massawa,  Treloar  et  al.,  2014;  Sadiola  Hill,  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press) 
suggests that region-wide gold mineralisation occurred  during a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics, after the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. Although not 
diagnostic  of  a  specific  fluid  source,  the  chemical  composition  of  syn-mineralisation 
hydrothermal tourmalines at Yatela is also consistent with that reported for Sadiola Hill 
(Masurel et al., in press) and for the Loulo-Bambadji  district (Lawrence  et al., 2013a; 
Lambert-Smith,  2014). At  the  district  scale,  the  primary  ore  paragenesis  at  Yatela  is 
compatible with the Au-As-Sb ± Cu-Ag-W-Mo-Bi-Zn-Pb-Te metal signature identified 
at  Sadiola  Hill  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  presence  of  pyrite  as  principal  sulphide 
phase  at  Yatela,  however,  is  interpreted  to  reflect  a  host-rock  dependency,  and/or  a 
spatial  zoning  of  metals  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone, 
157 || The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone acted as the main conduit 
for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa, 
Sadiola  Hill)  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of  West 
Africa  occurred  over  a  protracted  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics,  soon  after  the 
cessation of regional-scale contractional deformation. Despite the uncertainty regarding 
the  source  of  fluids  and  metals  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  hydrothermal  system,  the  late-
Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  activity  reflects  a  transient  geodynamic  process  that  may 
have been critical for orogenic gold mineralization in the region. 60 || The deposit therefore provides an ideal setting to investigate field relationships between 
magnetite  skarn  formation  and  gold  mineralization  in  the  region. Although  initial 
attempts  to  date  the  gold  mineralization  in-situ  have  failed,  this  study  outlines  the 
geology,  tectonic  setting,  contact  metamorphism,  absolute  timing,  and  whole  rock 
geochemistry of the local intrusive stocks, hydrothermal alteration, and ore mineralogy 
in  the  area  of  the  Alamoutala  gold  deposit. The  primary  conclusion  is  that  the 
Alamoutala  deposit  represents  a  locally-developed  magnetite-bearing  skarn  in  the 
aureole  to  the  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  that  was  overprinted  by  a  regional 
orogenic gold event in the late Eburnean. 3. Geological setting 
3.1. Regional geology  
The geology of the KKI consists of two volcanic rock belts (Mako and Falémé) 
separated  by  wider  sedimentary  basins  (Dialé-Daléma  and  Kofi)  (Fig. || The development of NNE-trending upright folds 
(F2)  and  penetrative  axial-planar  cleavage  (S2)  is  cryptic  at  Yatela  but  represents  the 
dominant structural feature 1.5 km west in the KW18 ancillary pits and 25 km south at 
the world-class Sadiola Hill gold deposit. Fold geometry and lineation data associated 
with  the  second  deformation  event  (D2y)  are  consistent  with  NW-SE  directed 
shortening. The  D2y  event  is  compatible  with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics 
responsible  for  the  region-wide  structural  grain  (D2)  (in  Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al., 
2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,  Hein,  2010;  in  Guinea,  Lahondère  et  al., 
2002;  in  Mali,  Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010; 
McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; in Senegal, Treloar et 
al.,  2014). Calc-alkaline  magmatic  suites  intruded  the  Birimian  volcano-sedimentary 
pile  at  ca. 2100  Ma  in  the  KKI  (Ndiaye  et  al.,  1997;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006;  Dioh  et  al., 
2006). The Yatela diorite was emplaced during D2y and has been dated at 2106 ± 10 Ma 
by  Hein  et  al. || and  southern  Ghana  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of 
West Africa occurred over a protracted interval between ca. 2100 to 2070 Ma, during a 
period of transcurrent tectonics, soon after the cessation of regional-scale contractional 
deformation  (e.g,  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b;  in  southern 
Mali,  Olson  et  al.,  1992;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011;  in  the  KKI,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a; 
Treloar et al., 2014). At Morila, orogenic gold mineralization has been dated at 2074 ± 
14 Ma (McFarlane et al., 2011: U-Pb on hydrothermal titanite). The structural evolution 
from early fold-and-thrust tectonics to strike-slip tectonics has been described in other 
orogenic belts (e.g. Vassallo and Wilson, 2002; Clegg and Holdsworth, 2005; Ulrich et 
al.,  2011)  and  is  typically  associated  with  gold-forming  events. At  Sadiola  Hill,  the 
Sadiola Fracture Zone was the dominant structure active during mineralization and has 
therefore focused the greatest amount of dilation and permeability. || gold  deposit  formation  in  the  KKI  occured  during  D3  NNW-SSE  shortening,  with 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  sinistral  regional-scale  shear  zones  and  steep 
NNE-trending  shears  connected  to  structural  traps  in  the  Kofi  basin  (Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Treloar et al., 2014; Masurel et al., in press). The last deformation event, D4, has 
been locally reported on the Senegalese side of the Falémé River and is correlated with 
the  late  dextral  reactivation  of  the  N-S-oriented  to  NNE-trending  structural  corridors 
during NE-SW-directed shortening (Dabo and Aïfa, 2011). Available metamorphic data 
for  the  KKI  point  to  peak  regional  metamorphism  under  greenschist-facies  conditions 
(Dia et al., 1997; Debat et al., 2003). Amphibolite-facies contact-metamorphic aureoles 
have  locally  been  observed  surrounding  late-Eburnean  granitoids  (Debat  et  al.,  1984; 
Pawlig et al., 2006). Mineral assemblages developed during regional metamorphism are 
overprinted  by  contact-metamorphic  mineral  assemblages  (Schwartz  and  Melcher, 
2004). Gold  deposits  in  the  region  are  unmetamorphosed  (Lawrence  et  al,  2013a; 
Masurel et al., in press). || lithospheric-scale  processes  (e.g.,  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006;  McCuaig  et  al.,  2010). Recent 
research in the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between late Eburnean calc-
alkaline plutons and gold mineralisation (Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014; 
Lambert-Smith, 2014; Masurel et al., in press a, b). The potential role a complex fluid 
history  involving  metamorphic  and  magmatic  sources  has  been  proposed  in  the 
development  of  major  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a,b;  Massawa, 
Treloar  et  al.,  2014). The  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity  has  also  been  proposed  to 
have participated in the generation of thermal gradients, which produced regional fluid 
systems capable of transpoting gold (e.g., Masurel et al., in press a,.b). Regardless of the 
variability in gold mineralisation at the deposit-scale, the late Ebrunean tectono-thermal 
event  may  represent 
the  geodynamic  engine 
that  empowered  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation  in  the  KKI. This  study  aims  at  (i)  documenting  the  petrographical-
geochemical  characteristics  and  absolute  timing  of  representative  igneous  rocks  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region and (ii) placing these rocks into a regional geological framework 
with respect to polycyclic deformation and gold mineralisation. || partly derived from the Mako bimodal volcanic rocks. Eburnean granitoids in the KKI 
display a similar evolution from calc-alkaline metaluminous diorite-granodiorite plutons 
to peraluminous high-K granites (e.g., Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye 
et  al.,  2008). Geochronological  data  also  shows  the  syn-volcanic  nature  of  Eburnean 
plutonism. Field relationships and geochronology data indicate that sediment deposition 
in the Kofi and Dialé-Daléma basins most likely initiated during early convergence (D1) 
coeval  with  the  onset  of  calc-alkaline  magmatism. The  diachroneity  of  the  recorded 
magmatic  ages  is  reflected  in  the  provenance  of  the  sediments,  which  further 
strengthened  the  hypothesis  that  the  Kofi  and  Dialé-Daléma  represented  syn-
deformational  basins  in  a  convergent  setting. The  evolution  from  fold-and-thrust 
tectonics  to  transcurrent  tectonics  identified  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  has  similarly 
been  proposed  for  the  Mako  area  (Diene  et  al.,  2012)  and  the  Loulo  area  (Dabo  and 
Aïfa,  2010;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a).",KKI,llm
2015_Masurel_phd.txt,"240,25,26","1.5. Gold mineralisation 
Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to

a  window  of  deformed  ca. 2200-2050  Ma  rocks  that  outcrops  in  eastern  Senegal  and

The  Paleoproterozoic  terranes  of  West  Africa  provide  a  complete  record  of 
crustal growth. The Kédougou-Kénieba inlier is the westernmost exposure of Birimian 
crust in the West African Craton and a world-class gold gold province. The bulk of the 
orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  inlier  has  been  related  to  a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics coeval with calc-alkaline magmatism in the late Eburnean (ca. 2090 and 2070 
Ma). In this study, the geology, structural framework, geochemistry (n=28) and focused 
geochronology (n=13) of representative magmatic rocks from the Sadiola-Yatela region 
are  presented  and  integrated  with  published  data  in  order  to  provide  the  tectono-
magmatic framework to gold mineralisation in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier. The  granitoids  from  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  display  a  temporal  evolution  from  ca. || Chapter  III. The  Alamoutala  carbonate-hosted  gold

deposits  of  various  types  have  been  recognised  in  these  Birimian  belts  and  include 
orogenic  gold  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b),  intrusion-related  gold  (e.g., 
Morila, McFarlane et al., 2011; Hammond et al., 2011), Cu-Au porphyry (e.g., Gaoua, 
public data from AMIRA International West African Initiative final report, 2013), and 
paleoplacer  (e.g.,  Tarkwa,  Pigois  et  al.,  2003). Detailed  deposit-scale  studies,  which 
integrated  structural-metamorphic-hydrothermal  data  with  high  precision  isotopic 
dating,  have  also  shown  evidence  for  distinct  gold  mineralisation  pulses  (e.g.,  2191-

al.,  1998;  2063  ±  9  Ma  gold  at  Damang,  Pigois  et  al.,  2003). Nevertheless,  the  vast 
majority  of  world-class  gold  deposits  in  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  belong  to  the 
orogenic  class  (e.g.,  Groves  et  al.,  1998;  Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;

The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold

inlier  (KKI)  represents 
the

outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-

using Leapfrog® Mining and refined with advancing mapping. The trends of ore shoots 
in the orebodies were evaluated using three-dimensional rendering of grade control and

regional  mapping  transects  were  undertaken  using  of  a  rugged  tablet  containing 
geophysical data such as magnetics and radiometrics under ArcGIS. Two transects were 
undertaken  across  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  from  East  to  West  and  two  transects 
investigated  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kofi  basin  all  the  way  to  the  escarpment  of

were  intruded  by  different  generations  of  syn-tectonic,  calc-alkaline  plutons  forming 
circular to elliptical bodies of various sizes (Fig. 2). A large plutonic complex has been 
mapped  in  the  field  2  km  west  of  the  Alamoutala  deposit. The  plutons  range  in 
composition from diorite and hornblende-biotite-granodiorite to K-rich biotite-granites. The  Alamoutala  deposit  is  located  within  the  Kofi  basin  and  occurs  in  the  contact-
metamorphic aureole to isolated intermediate quartz-feldspar-porphyry stocks. Country 
rocks  in  the  Alamoutala  deposit  area  have  undergone  regional  greenschist-facies 
metamorphism. || The  Falémé  belt  (Fig. 1)  consists  of  calc-alkaline  volcaniclastic  rocks,  wackes,  chert, 
manganiferous  shale,  minor  andesitic  lavas,  and  local  rhyolite  flows  (Ndiaye  et  al., 
1997; Hirdes and Davis 2002; Lawrence, 2010). The Falémé belt has been intruded by 
numerous  syn-tectonic,  belt-type,  calc-alkaline  granitoids  (Ndiaye  et  al.,  1997;  Hirdes 
and  Davis,  2002)  such  as  the  Boto  tonalite  dated  at  2082  ±  1  Ma  and  the  Boboti 
granodiorite dated at 2080 ± 1 Ma (Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Pb-Pb zircon). The plutons 
are spatially and genetically associated with iron skarns of the Falémé district (Schwartz 
and Melcher, 2004). The  Kofi  basin,  which  is  host  to  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit,  consists  of  a  sequence  of 
carbonates, wackes, arenites, siltstones, and calcareous clastic rocks (Fig. 1) (Lawrence 
et al., 2013a). || The  geology  of  the  Kofi  basin  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region consists of carbonate and detrital sedimentary rocks that exhibit 
KFMASH assemblages (e.g., biotite, chlorite, muscovite, quartz, K-feldspar) indicative 
of  regional  greenschist-facies  metamorphic  conditions. For  the  purpose  of  clarity,  the 
prefix  “meta”  will  be  omitted  in  the  following  section. Carbonate  rocks  consist  of 
impure  limestones  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  area  and  are  characterised  by  abundant 
thin  (0.2-2  cm)  argillaceous-silty  interbeds. Carbonate  rocks  elsewhere  in  the  region 
consist  of  limestones  locally  interlayered  with  dolomitic  horizons. Meso-scale 
disharmonic slump folds were mapped in carbonate rocks at the Sadiola Hill and FE3 
open pits. The overlying detrital sedimentary rock sequences exhibit way-up indicators 
such  as  fining-upwards  sequences,  scour-and-fill  structures,  and  rare  cross-bedding  in 
sandstone, which altogether indicate a younging to the West. || The  polycyclic  deformation  recorded  in  sedimentary  and  magmatic 
rocks of the region includes a period of early convergence (D1s), followed by a period of 
fold-and-thrust tectonics (D2s), and later transcurrent tectonics (D3s-D4s). The bulk of the 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occured  during  D3s,  with  sinistral  displacement  and 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  steep  NNE-
trending shear zones connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. The  results  of  this  study,  when  integrated  with  published  data,  indicate  that  the  late 
Eburnean  tectono-thermal  event  between  2080  and  2060  Ma  represented  the 
geodynamic  engine  that  empowered  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Kédougou-
Kénieba  inlier. The  new  data  also  further  supports  the  hypothesis  that  the  Eburnean 
tectono-magmatic activity affected the Baoulé-Mossi domain diachronously from SE to 
NW. 2. Introduction

the gold mineralisation in the region occured during D3s, with sinistral displacement and 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  steep  NNE-

Shear  Zone,  however,  does  not  correlate  in  the  field  with  a  continuous  crustal-scale 
structure  (e.g.,  Bassot  and  Dommanget,  1986;  Ledru  et  al.,  1991). In  contrast,  the 
Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is represented by alterning high strain and low strain domains 
separating  two  distinct  volcanic  and  sedimentary  lithostratigraphic  domains  that  occur 
at similar metamorphic grades. Within the high strain domains, microtectonic evidence 
such  as  stretched  porphyroclasts  and  symmetrical  strain  shadows  indicate  a  dominant 
component of flattening (i.e. pure shear deformation). Such results are consistent with 
the  interpretation  that  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  formed  as  a  transpressional  fault 
during the onset of D2s (Lawrence et al., 2013a). || gold  deposit  formation  in  the  KKI  occured  during  D3  NNW-SSE  shortening,  with 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  sinistral  regional-scale  shear  zones  and  steep 
NNE-trending  shears  connected  to  structural  traps  in  the  Kofi  basin  (Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Treloar et al., 2014; Masurel et al., in press). The last deformation event, D4, has 
been locally reported on the Senegalese side of the Falémé River and is correlated with 
the  late  dextral  reactivation  of  the  N-S-oriented  to  NNE-trending  structural  corridors 
during NE-SW-directed shortening (Dabo and Aïfa, 2011). Available metamorphic data 
for  the  KKI  point  to  peak  regional  metamorphism  under  greenschist-facies  conditions 
(Dia et al., 1997; Debat et al., 2003). Amphibolite-facies contact-metamorphic aureoles 
have  locally  been  observed  surrounding  late-Eburnean  granitoids  (Debat  et  al.,  1984; 
Pawlig et al., 2006). Mineral assemblages developed during regional metamorphism are 
overprinted  by  contact-metamorphic  mineral  assemblages  (Schwartz  and  Melcher, 
2004). Gold  deposits  in  the  region  are  unmetamorphosed  (Lawrence  et  al,  2013a;

Eburnean  tectono-thermal  event  (ca. 2090-2060  Ma). The  change  in  sedimentary  rock 
facies deposition from carbonate sequences to flysch-type detrital sedimentary rocks in 
the  Kofi  basin  may  reflect  the  onset  of  the  Eburnean  orogeny  (i.e. advanced

Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation

1997; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye et al., 2007, 
2008). Intensive  studies  of  the  Eburnean  granitoids  have  focused  on  the  western  and 
southern parts of the KKI but limited data exist for the eastern part of the inlier, which 
hosts  the  world-class  Loulo  and  Sadiola-Yatela  gold  districts. Hence,  the  study  of 
igneous  rocks  in  that  exceptionally  gold-endowed  region  appears  critical  not  only  to 
unravel  the  tectono-thermal  evolution  of  the  KKI  crust  but  also  in  terms  of  mineral

district, which collectively represent the largest Birimian iron resource of West Africa 
(750  Mt  ore  reserves,  ArcellorMittal  2007,  press  release)  (Fig. 1). The  iron  skarns 
formed  post-peak  metamorphism  at  ca. 2080  Ma  and  are  spatially  and  genetically 
associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons,  such  as  the  Balangouma  monzodiorite  and  the 
Boboti  clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing  granodiorite  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002; 
Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Lambert-Smith,  2014). Recent 
research in the eastern part of the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between 
calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron skarn mineralization,

and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; McFarlane et al., 2011; in the 
KKI,  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || Available  geochronological  data  suggest  that  the 
emplacement of most granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. 2115 
and 2060 Ma, which is the best time estimate for the Eburnean orogeny in the KKI. The 
iron skarns of the Falémé district formed post-peak metamorphism at ca. 2080 Ma and 
are  spatially  and  genetically  associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons  such  as  the 
Balangouma  monzodiorite 
and 
the  Boboti 
clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing 
granodiorite  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Lawrence  et  al.,

gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela region and other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014) suggests that gold mineralisation 
occurred  subsequently  during  a  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics  that  outlasted 
emplacement  of  the  peraluminous  high-K  granites,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional  deformation. It  is  likely  that  the  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity 
participated  in  the  generation  of  thermal  gradients,  which  produced  regional  fluid 
systems  capable  of  transpoting  gold  (e.g.,  Masurel  et  al.,  a,  b). || Recent  discoveries  in  the  inlier  include  the 
Fekola  gold  deposit  (3.72  Moz  probable  mineral  reserves,  B2Gold  press  release,  July 
2015) and the Petowal gold deposit (mineral resource of 1.35 Moz contained Au, public 
data  from  ToroGold  website,  2015). Recent  research  in  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the 
spatial  association  between  calc-alkaline  Eburnean  plutons,  gold  mineralisation,  and 
local iron skarn mineralisation, suggesting the potential role of a complex fluid history

structural setting to that of other world-class orogenic gold systems in the West African 
Craton  (e.g. Ashanti,  Loulo),  with  gold  deposition  occurring  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent tectonics soon after the cessation of region-wide contractional deformation. The high temperature ore and alteration paragenesis at Sadiola Hill is atypical of gold 
mineralization  in  the  craton  and  indicates  that  the  late  Eburnean  tectono-magmatic 
activity  between  ca. 2090  and  2070  Ma  played  an  important  role  in  the  dynamics  of 
hydrothermal fluid circulation along the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. 2. Introduction

belts and sedimentary basins by the abundance of carbonate rocks. The Yatela deposit 
occurs within 8 km of the regional-scale Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. Country rocks in the 
Yatela region have been subjected to polycyclic deformation and regional greenschist-
facies metamorphism. A syn-kinematic diorite stock has intruded the metasedimentary 
sequences in the open pit and is associated with a hornblende-hornfels contact aureole. Field relationships and micro-textural data indicate that the primary gold mineralisation 
is  shear-hosted. The  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  Yatela 
primary  gold  mineralisation  and  other  world-class  deposits  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Loulo,

131 || The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurred  during  D3y  based  on  field  relationships  and 
micro-textural observations. The equivalent structural setting and relative timing of gold 
between Yatela and other world-class gold deposits in the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence 
et  al.,  2013a;  Massawa,  Treloar  et  al.,  2014;  Sadiola  Hill,  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press) 
suggests that region-wide gold mineralisation occurred  during a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics, after the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. Although not 
diagnostic  of  a  specific  fluid  source,  the  chemical  composition  of  syn-mineralisation 
hydrothermal tourmalines at Yatela is also consistent with that reported for Sadiola Hill 
(Masurel et al., in press) and for the Loulo-Bambadji  district (Lawrence  et al., 2013a; 
Lambert-Smith,  2014). At  the  district  scale,  the  primary  ore  paragenesis  at  Yatela  is 
compatible with the Au-As-Sb ± Cu-Ag-W-Mo-Bi-Zn-Pb-Te metal signature identified 
at  Sadiola  Hill  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  presence  of  pyrite  as  principal  sulphide 
phase  at  Yatela,  however,  is  interpreted  to  reflect  a  host-rock  dependency,  and/or  a 
spatial  zoning  of  metals  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone, 
157 || The  second  event  (D2)  is  associated  with  the  formation  of  the  SMSZ  as  a  sinistral 
transpressional  fault  under  NW-SE  directed  shortening  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). Hydrothermal  fluid  flow  and  regional  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  along  the  SMSZ 
(e.g, Loulo, Gounkoto, Sadiola Hill) (Fig. 1) occurred subsequently during the D3 event, 
which marked a switch from a dominantly coaxial system to a non-coaxial deformation 
regime  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  last  deformation  event 
(D4)  has  been  locally  reported  in  the  Loulo  deposit  area  and  is  correlated  with  the 
dextral  reactivation  of  the  earlier  accretionary  structures. Available  metamorphic  data 
indicate  regional  peak  metamorphic  conditions  reached  greenschist-facies  (e.g.,  Dia  et 
al.,  1997;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Gueye  et  al.,  2008)  with  local  hornblende-hornfels 
contact  aureoles  surrounding  Eburnean  granitoids  (Debat  et  al.,  1984;  Pawlig  et  al., 
2006; Masurel et al., in press). 134 || The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone acted as the main conduit 
for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa, 
Sadiola  Hill)  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of  West 
Africa  occurred  over  a  protracted  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics,  soon  after  the 
cessation of regional-scale contractional deformation. Despite the uncertainty regarding 
the  source  of  fluids  and  metals  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  hydrothermal  system,  the  late-
Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  activity  reflects  a  transient  geodynamic  process  that  may 
have been critical for orogenic gold mineralization in the region. 60 || lithospheric-scale  processes  (e.g.,  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006;  McCuaig  et  al.,  2010). Recent 
research in the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between late Eburnean calc-
alkaline plutons and gold mineralisation (Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014; 
Lambert-Smith, 2014; Masurel et al., in press a, b). The potential role a complex fluid 
history  involving  metamorphic  and  magmatic  sources  has  been  proposed  in  the 
development  of  major  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a,b;  Massawa, 
Treloar  et  al.,  2014). The  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity  has  also  been  proposed  to 
have participated in the generation of thermal gradients, which produced regional fluid 
systems capable of transpoting gold (e.g., Masurel et al., in press a,.b). Regardless of the 
variability in gold mineralisation at the deposit-scale, the late Ebrunean tectono-thermal 
event  may  represent 
the  geodynamic  engine 
that  empowered  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation  in  the  KKI. This  study  aims  at  (i)  documenting  the  petrographical-
geochemical  characteristics  and  absolute  timing  of  representative  igneous  rocks  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region and (ii) placing these rocks into a regional geological framework 
with respect to polycyclic deformation and gold mineralisation.",Loulo,llm

of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa,

mineralisation at Gara in the Loulo district reported by Vielreicher (U-Pb on xenotime

the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted 
from hydrothermal systems that sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and 
magmatic reservoirs. Such diversity appears to be largely controlled by the distance of 
the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links 
between  gold  mineralization  and  magnetite  skarn  development  in  the  region  (e.g.,

5.1. Integration with regional geology and tectonics 
At least two phases of folding have affected the country rocks in the Yatela area. The  pervasive  steep  NW-trending  cleavage  (S1)  and  associated  lineation  data  are 
consistent with NE-SW directed shortening (D1y). This deformation event is correlated 
with  the  folding  and  thrusting  of  the  lithostratigraphic  units  in  the  region. This  early 
event (D1y) has been similarly reported in the Mako volcanic belt where it is correlated 
with  stratigraphic  stacking  and  the  formation  of  a  NNW-trending  planar  fabric  (D1  in 
Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). || Gueye et al., 2008; Lawrence, 2010). Available geochronological data are limited to a 
rhyolite  flow  dated  at  2099 ± 4 Ma  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002),  but  indicate  a  late 
Birimian formation in relation to the Mako volcanic belt. Geochemical studies carried 
out  on  both  the  Mako  and  Falémé  volcanic  rocks  are  consistent  with  a  volcanic  arc 
setting (Dia et al., 1997; Schwartz and Melcher, 2004; Dioh et al., 2006; Pawlig et al.,

sequences of volcaniclastic rocks, arenites, wackes, siltstones, argillites, and carbonates,

Mines  d’Or  du  Mali  (SEMOS),  a  joint  venture  between  AngloGold  Ashanti  Limited, 
IAMGold  Corporation,  and  the  government  of  Mali. The  region  displays  widespread 
evidence of ancient and recent artisanal mining, and written records of mining date back 
more  than  300  years  (public  data  from  IAMGOLD  website). However,  the 
development  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  mine  began  in  1992  and  was  based  on  proven  and 
probable reserves amounting to 49.2 Mt of oxide and partly oxidized ore at an average 
grade of 2.86 g/t Au, representing approximately 4.5 Moz (141 t) of contained gold to 
an average depth of 140 m (Boshoff et al., 1998). || 1). In  late 
1997, IAMGOLD and Anglo American Corporation (now AngloGold  Ashanti) signed 
an agreement to purchase the Yatela concession located 25 km north of the Sadiola Hill 
gold  deposit. The  Government  of  Mali  issued  an  exploitation  permit  for  the  Yatela 
project in February 2000. The Alamoutala gold deposit has been operated by the Société 
des  Mines  d’Or  du  Mali  (SEMOS),  a  joint  venture  between  AngloGold  Ashanti 
Limited,  IAMGold  Corporation  and  the  government  of  Mali,  until  the  mine  was 
decommissioned in 2012. The total production of the Alamoutala gold deposit over its 
mine life was 308,400 oz Au at an average grade of 1.70 g/t (AngloGold Ashanti 2011

deposits  in  the  KKI  sharing  a  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting,  gold 
mineralization  occurs  in  a  variety  of  styles  including  epizonal  orogenic  Au-As-Sb 
mineralization  at  Massawa  (~3.6  Moz)  (Treloar  et  al.,  2014),  As-rich  orogenic  gold 
mineralization  at  Yalea  (~6.3  Moz),  and  polymetallic  Fe-B-rich  orogenic  gold 
mineralization at Gara (~3.1 Moz) (Lawrence et al., 2013a, b). These gold deposits have 
developed  synchronously  with  the  generation  of  large  melt  volumes,  leading  to  the 
possibility of a genetic connection. Recent  studies  by  Lawrence  et  al. (2013a,  b)  and  Treloar  et  al. || 1.5. Gold mineralisation 
Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || 2160 and 2115 Ma (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo 
and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; McFarlane et al., 2011; in the 
KKI,  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || Available  geochronological  data  suggest  that  the 
emplacement of most granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. 2115 
and 2060 Ma, which is the best time estimate for the Eburnean orogeny in the KKI. The 
iron skarns of the Falémé district formed post-peak metamorphism at ca. 2080 Ma and 
are  spatially  and  genetically  associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons  such  as  the 
Balangouma  monzodiorite 
and 
the  Boboti 
clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing 
granodiorite  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Lambert-Smith, 2014). The similar relative timing and structural setting between 
gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela region and other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014) suggests that gold mineralisation 
occurred  subsequently  during  a  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics  that  outlasted 
emplacement  of  the  peraluminous  high-K  granites,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional  deformation. It  is  likely  that  the  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity 
participated  in  the  generation  of  thermal  gradients,  which  produced  regional  fluid 
systems  capable  of  transpoting  gold  (e.g.,  Masurel  et  al.,  a,  b). || Hill  hydrothermal  system  remains  uncertain. Indeed,  although  a  magmatic  source  is 
indicated at Massawa (Treloar et al., 2014) and may be proposed for Sadiola Hill, gold 
deposits  of  the  Kweke  district  in  the  Archean  Midlands  greenstone  belt  of  Zimbabwe 
are  associated  with  low  salinity,  mixed  aqueous-carbonic  fluid  inclusions  and  stable 
isotope  data  indicating  a  homogeneous  metamorphic  or  mixed  metamorphic  and/or 
magmatic  fluid  source  for  both  the  Au-As  and  the  Au-Sb  mineralization  stages 
(Buchholz et al., 2007). 8. Conclusions 
The  presented  field  and  mineralogical  data  suggest  that  the  Sadiola  Hill 
carbonate-hosted Au-As-Sb mineralization formed during a period of sinistral tectonics 
(i.e. D3s  NNW-SSE  shortening)  that  was  coeval  with  calc-alkaline  magmatic  activity 
between ca. 2090 and 2070 Ma. || Recent  discoveries  in  the  inlier  include  the 
Fekola  gold  deposit  (3.72  Moz  probable  mineral  reserves,  B2Gold  press  release,  July 
2015) and the Petowal gold deposit (mineral resource of 1.35 Moz contained Au, public 
data  from  ToroGold  website,  2015). Recent  research  in  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the 
spatial  association  between  calc-alkaline  Eburnean  plutons,  gold  mineralisation,  and 
local iron skarn mineralisation, suggesting the potential role of a complex fluid history 
in  the  development  of  major  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a,  b; 
Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Falémé, Lambert-Smith, 2014). 2 || The  geology  of  the  KKI  differs  from  other  Paleoproterozoic  granite-greenstone 
belts and sedimentary basins by the abundance of carbonate rocks. The Yatela deposit 
occurs within 8 km of the regional-scale Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. Country rocks in the 
Yatela region have been subjected to polycyclic deformation and regional greenschist-
facies metamorphism. A syn-kinematic diorite stock has intruded the metasedimentary 
sequences in the open pit and is associated with a hornblende-hornfels contact aureole. Field relationships and micro-textural data indicate that the primary gold mineralisation 
is  shear-hosted. The  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  Yatela 
primary  gold  mineralisation  and  other  world-class  deposits  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Loulo,

131 || The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurred  during  D3y  based  on  field  relationships  and 
micro-textural observations. The equivalent structural setting and relative timing of gold 
between Yatela and other world-class gold deposits in the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence 
et  al.,  2013a;  Massawa,  Treloar  et  al.,  2014;  Sadiola  Hill,  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press) 
suggests that region-wide gold mineralisation occurred  during a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics, after the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. Although not 
diagnostic  of  a  specific  fluid  source,  the  chemical  composition  of  syn-mineralisation 
hydrothermal tourmalines at Yatela is also consistent with that reported for Sadiola Hill 
(Masurel et al., in press) and for the Loulo-Bambadji  district (Lawrence  et al., 2013a; 
Lambert-Smith,  2014). At  the  district  scale,  the  primary  ore  paragenesis  at  Yatela  is 
compatible with the Au-As-Sb ± Cu-Ag-W-Mo-Bi-Zn-Pb-Te metal signature identified 
at  Sadiola  Hill  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  presence  of  pyrite  as  principal  sulphide 
phase  at  Yatela,  however,  is  interpreted  to  reflect  a  host-rock  dependency,  and/or  a 
spatial  zoning  of  metals  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone, 
157 || The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone acted as the main conduit 
for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa, 
Sadiola  Hill)  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of  West 
Africa  occurred  over  a  protracted  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics,  soon  after  the 
cessation of regional-scale contractional deformation. Despite the uncertainty regarding 
the  source  of  fluids  and  metals  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  hydrothermal  system,  the  late-
Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  activity  reflects  a  transient  geodynamic  process  that  may 
have been critical for orogenic gold mineralization in the region. 60 || lithospheric-scale  processes  (e.g.,  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006;  McCuaig  et  al.,  2010). Recent 
research in the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between late Eburnean calc-
alkaline plutons and gold mineralisation (Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014; 
Lambert-Smith, 2014; Masurel et al., in press a, b). The potential role a complex fluid 
history  involving  metamorphic  and  magmatic  sources  has  been  proposed  in  the 
development  of  major  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a,b;  Massawa, 
Treloar  et  al.,  2014). The  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity  has  also  been  proposed  to 
have participated in the generation of thermal gradients, which produced regional fluid 
systems capable of transpoting gold (e.g., Masurel et al., in press a,.b). Regardless of the 
variability in gold mineralisation at the deposit-scale, the late Ebrunean tectono-thermal 
event  may  represent 
the  geodynamic  engine 
that  empowered  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation  in  the  KKI. This  study  aims  at  (i)  documenting  the  petrographical-
geochemical  characteristics  and  absolute  timing  of  representative  igneous  rocks  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region and (ii) placing these rocks into a regional geological framework

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted 
from hydrothermal systems that sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and 
magmatic reservoirs. Such diversity appears to be largely controlled by the distance of 
the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links 
between  gold  mineralization  and  magnetite  skarn  development  in  the  region  (e.g., 
Falémé  iron  district). The  shear-hosted  Massawa  deposit  occurs  within  3  km  of  the

include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West

14 Ma (McFarlane et al., 2011: U-Pb on hydrothermal titanite). The structural evolution 
from early fold-and-thrust tectonics to strike-slip tectonics has been described in other

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted 
from hydrothermal systems that sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and 
magmatic reservoirs. Such diversity appears to be largely controlled by the distance of 
the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links 
between  gold  mineralization  and  magnetite  skarn  development  in  the  region  (e.g., 
Falémé  iron  district). The  shear-hosted  Massawa  deposit  occurs  within  3  km  of  the 
MTZ  and  is  related  to  a  magmatic  fluid  derived  from  syn-kinematic  quartz-feldspar-
porphyry  sills. The  goal  of  this  contribution  is  to  summarize  the  geology,  tectonic 
setting, hydrothermal alteration, and ore mineralogy of the Sadiola Hill gold deposit in 
an attempt to clarify its genesis. || Bassot  (1987)  defined  the  Mako  belt  to  the  west  of  the  MTZ  and  the  Dialé-
Daléma  basin  to  the  east. The  Falémé  belt  is  recognized  as  a  distinct  entity  from  the 
Dialé-Daléma  basin  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002; Lawrence, 2010) and is bordered to the 
east  by  the  SMSZ. The  Kofi  basin,  as  first  defined  by  Klöckner  Industrie  (1989),  is 
situated east of the SMSZ. The Dialé-Daléma and Kofi sedimentary basins contain the 
most extensive occurrence of carbonate rocks in the Birimian (Bessoles, 1977). The  Mako  belt  (Fig. 1)  consists  of  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  andesitic  lavas 
intercalated  with  minor  immature  sedimentary  and  volcaniclastic  rocks  (Hirdes  and 
Davis, 2002; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye et al., 2008). || The  second  event  (D2)  is  associated  with  the  formation  of  the  SMSZ  as  a  sinistral 
transpressional  fault  under  NW-SE  directed  shortening  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). Hydrothermal  fluid  flow  and  regional  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  along  the  SMSZ

The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West

exposure in the Birimian of West Africa (Bosse et al., 1996; Bering et al., 1998). The 
structural  architecture  of  the  inlier  is  marked  by  two  regional-scale  tectonic 
discontinuities, respectively the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone and Main Transcurrent Zone. A  number  of  world-class  mining  districts  are  located  along  these  highly  prospective

Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || 6.4. Deposit-scale gold distribution  
Leapfrog® was used to produce a three-dimensional rendering of the assay data 
(combined grade control and exploration) in order to better visualize and evaluate trends 
both within and surrounding the Sadiola deposit orebody. The bulk of the ore is hosted 
within the brittle-ductile Sadiola Fracture Zone and footwall impure carbonates (Fig. 5). Mineralization also occurs along the array of NNE-trending shears, although gold grade 
decreases  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  (Fig. 5). || 7.3. Towards a genetic model… 
The Sadiola Hill deposit shares a number of characteristics typical of  orogenic 
gold deposits worldwide (Mikucki and Ridley, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; McCuaig and 
Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Goldfarb et al., 
2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006)  including  a  late-orogenic  relative 
timing,  strong  regional  (i.e.,  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone)  and  local  structural  controls 
(i.e.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  NNE-trending  shear  array)  on  ore  location  and 
geometry,  and  a  pronounced  Au-As-Sb  metal  enrichment  association. The  metal 
enrichment  association  and  geothermometric  estimates  from  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis are compatible with mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-
epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-300°C) conditions in terms of crustal level based on the 
proposed classification of orogenic gold deposits by Groves et al. (1998). However, the 
high  temperature  ore  and  alteration  paragenesis  at  Sadiola  Hill  is  in  thermal 
disequilibrium  with  host  rocks  at  regional  greenschist-facies  conditions,  which  is 
atypical  for  that  class  of  deposit. Such  geological  feature  alone  is  not  diagnostic  of  a 
magmatic fluid source because it can reflect the interaction of a fluid from any source 
with reactive country rocks at a temperature high enough to form stable actinolite and 
biotite  (Ridley  and  Diamond,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). || A  minor 
part of the ore is hosted by detrital sedimentary rocks, quartz-feldspar-porphyries, and 
diorites within the Sadiola Fracture Zone and along the NNE-trending shears. The bulk 
of  the  ore  is  concentrated  in  the  southern  half  of  the  pit  and  correlates  with  an 
approximately  45°  south-dipping  high-grade  ore  shoot  identified  on  a  longitudinal 
section  (Fig. 5). Numerous  20°  to  25°  south-dipping  high-grade  ore  shoots  are  also 
indicated  on  the  surface  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  (Fig. 5). Finally,  the  3D  model 
shows 
that  some  of 
these  high-grade  ore  shoots  coincide  with  a 
left-hand 
(anticlockwise) flexure of the Sadiola Fracture Zone (See Fig. || A distinct set of NNE- to NE-trending late diorite dikes (<2 m wide) was identified in 
the  pit  (Fig. 3). Although  no  direct  crosscutting  relationships  could  be  observed  at 
Sadiola Hill, these dikes crosscut the quartz-feldspar-phyric felsic dikes at the Tambali 
ancillary pits, which are situated 2 km southwest of the Sadiola Hill deposit (See Fig. 2). 6.3. Structural setting and geometry 
The  broad  structure  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  open  pit  is  dominated  by  the  N-S  to 
NNW-trending  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  an  array  of  NNE-trending  shears  (Fig. || Biotite  marks  the  fabric  in  host  rocks  within  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  along  the 
NNE-trending shears (Fig. 8D). The potassic alteration halo in country rocks occurs in 
the  form  of  pervasive  biotite  and  extends  beyond  the  extent  of  the  current  open  pit. Biotite  minerals  are  also  developed  along  axial-planar  fabric  associated  with  F2  folds 
(Fig. 8E), associated with calcite and muscovite as patchy replacement of the tremolite-
actinolite  clots,  present  as  veins  with  calcite-quartz-tourmaline-sulfides  and  in 
surrounding  wall-rocks  of  such  veins,  and  as  disseminations  in  the  argillaceous-silty 
interbeds  in  footwall  limestones. The  type  of  mica  in  the  alteration  assemblages  is,  at 
least in part, lithologically-controlled. || Combined  channel  sampling  and  three-dimensional  rendering  of  the  assay 
data under Modelling under Leapfrog® shows that the linkage of steep  NNE-trending 
shears  with  reactivated  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone, 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone, and FE4 Shear Zone) applied a direct control on ore shoot 
geometries in the Sadiola Hill, Alamoutala, FE3, and FE4 gold deposits (Fig. 4E-F). A very late deformation episode (D4s) is associated with a dextral reactivation of earlier 
accretionary  structures. Chlorite-calcite  slickenfibres  on  rare  fault  walls  from  the 
Sadiola  Hill  and Alamoutala  open pits indicate late dextral displacement. Steep NNE-
trending  faults  associated  with  dextral  displacement  have  been  mapped  locally  in 
outcrop  over  the  Finman  plutonic  complex. The  apparent  dextral  offset  of  the  Sadiola 
volcanics in map scale is tentatively associated with D4s. || Ductile textures are best-observed in the diorite dikes within the Sadiola Fracture Zone, 
where  fine-grained  sulfides  are  consistently  aligned  parallel  to  the  shear  fabric  (Fig. 7A). Sheared  greywackes  in  the  hangingwall  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  exhibit  a 
well-defined fabric marked by sulfides, and by lenses and augen-shaped pods of quartz 
reflecting deformation of early quartz veins (Fig. 7B). Gold grades in the ductile part of 
the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  are  commonly  >10  g/t. Ductile  textures  are  also  observed 
along  the  NNE-trending  shears  in  deformed  quartz-feldspar-phyric  dikes. || Figure  3. Structural  correlation  chart  including  data  collected  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  open  pit,  the

Alamoutala Fracture Zone. 188 || Hydrothermal alteration 
Based  on  diagnostic 
textural  and  mineralogical  features,  a  polyphase 
hydrothermal  alteration  history  has  been  identified  at  Sadiola  Hill. An  early  high-
temperature phase is recorded by the porphyroblastic growth of actinolite-tremolite. In 
drill  core,  this  alteration  phase  is  characterised  by  dark  green  clots  and  box-shaped 
spots, millimetric to centimetric in size (≤1 cm). Actinolite-tremolite porphyroblasts are 
locally strongly developed within the Sadiola Fracture Zone and to a lesser extent along 
the  NNE-trending  faults  (Fig. 8A). This  assemblage  has  been  observed  in  silty-
argillaceous interbeds in limestones, in greywackes and as rare occurrences in the early 
diorite. || It is characterized by sinistral 
movement along both the Sadiola Fracture Zone and the NNE-trending shears, synchronous with 
the  potassic  hydrothermal  alteration  stage  and  gold  mineralization. The  latest  recorded  event  is 
associated  with  the  formation  of  WNW-trending  sub-vertical  brittle  cross-faults  that  offset 
mineralization trends. 7.2. Physico-chemical  conditions  of  the  ore-forming  fluid  and 
potential controls on Au-Sb co-precipitation 
The  principal  parameters  that  are  generally  assumed  to  control  ore  mineral 
solubility, other than the activities of the aqueous metallic species, are temperature (T), 
pressure  (P),  oxygen  fugacity  (f02),  pH  and  the  total  sulphur  activity  (Σas)  (Williams-
Jones  and  Normand,  1997). Gold  saturation  and  precipitation  at  Sadiola  Hill  is 
interpreted to have occurred predominantly in response to decompression during brittle-
ductile  failure  and  sulfidation  reactions  during  fluid  -  wall-rock  interaction. The 
extensive brecciation recorded over the best-mineralized drill core intersects illustrates 
the enhanced and cumulative dilation that has developed along the vertical and left-hand 
flexures  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone. || Sadiola  Hill  structural  context:  A)  Interference  pattern  resulting  from  refolding  of 
recumbent F1 by upright F2 folds. B) Typical field observation of F2 folding in impure limestones 
looking  down  stretching  lineation. The  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  (SFZ)  is  indicated  to  provide 
additional  structural  context. C)  Bench  view  in  the  central  part  of  the  pit  illustrating  the 
relationship  between  F2  folds,  thrusts  and  high-angle  sinistral  shears. D)  Steeply  north-plunging 
parasitic folds in transposed impure limestones located <50 m east off the Sadiola Fracture Zone. The S-shaped fold asymmetry indicates sinistral movement along the main shear. || Scattered and 
variably-oriented sulfide veinlets and stringers comprise the remaining 5 % of the ore. A range of ductile to brittle ore textures is observed at the Sadiola Hill deposit. Brittle 
textures  are  well-developed  in  the  steeply-dipping  segments  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture 
Zone,  whereas  ductile  textures  are  best-observed  in  the  moderately-dipping  segments 
(Fig. 6). The  bedding  angular  relationship  that  is  observed  in  cross-section  between 
footwall  impure  limestones  and  hangingwall  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  corresponds 
with the change in dip of the Sadiola Fracture Zone at depth (Fig. 6). || Such clots are superimposed on the bedding-parallel foliation in footwall impure 
limestones,  but  are  stretched  along  the  shear  fabric  within  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone. Deep  drilling  has  not  indicated  zoning  surrounding  any  of  the  intrusions,  but  it  does 
show  a  strong  correlation  between  the  early  alteration  assemblage  and  the  Sadiola 
Fracture  Zone  and  NNE-trending  shears. Zones  altered  with  actinolite-tremolite  clots 
have  been  identified  up  to  200  m  away  from  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  in  footwall

represented  by  the  N-S-  to  NNW-trending  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone. Impure  limestones 
(>250 m thick) crop out on the eastern walls of the pit and are interlayered with minor 
dolomitic  horizons. The  limestone  is  well-bedded  and  characterized  by  abundant  thin 
(0.2-2  cm)  argillaceous-silty  interbeds. The  impure  limestones  have  recrystallized  as 
silty  marbles  adjacent  to  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  along  the 
steep NNE-trending faults. Detrital sedimentary rocks crop out on the western walls of

decimeter-scale  beds  (Fig. 3). || The Sadiola Hill Fracture Zone, the Alamoutala Fracture Zone, and the FE4 Shear Zone 
(Fig. 3) represent sheared litho-stratigraphic interfaces (see Fig. 2). Such structures are 
2-50m  wide  and  are  associated  with  a  pinch-and-swell  anastomosing  geometry  that 
extends  both  along  strike  and  down  dip. These  shear  zones  are  discontinuous  along 
strike  in  contrast  to  the  high-angle  NNE-trending  shear  zones. Steeply-plunging 
parasitic folds in transposed impure marbles within 25 m of the Sadiola Fracture Zone 
exhibit  an  S-shaped  asymmetry,  indicating  of  a  component  of  sinistral  displacement 
along the structure (Fig. || The main ore shoots 
plunge  45°S,  indicating  that  mineralization  resulted  from  the  sinistral-normal  linkage 
between the Sadiola Fracture Zone and the NNE-trending shears (Fig. 12). Within the 
KKI, NW-SE shortening in a transpressive regime has similarly been proposed for the 
Kolia-Boboti  sedimentary  basin  (Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012)  and  in  a 
transtensional regime for the Loulo district (Lawrence et al., 2013a). Vein geometry and 
kinematic  indicators  associated  with  the  steep  NE-trending  barren  quartz  veins 
(240°/65°NW)  present  at  Sadiola  Hill  are  consistent  with  a  late  phase  of  NW-SE 
extension (D4s). These veins post-date mineralization. The last local deformation event 
(D5s) is associated with the formation of WNW-trending sub-vertical brittle cross-faults 
(Fig. || Tourmaline  is  structurally-controlled  and  occurs  as  a  euhedral,  rod-  and  heart-shaped 
accessory mineral (up to 2%). Tourmaline is observed in quartz-calcite-biotite veins and 
in narrow selvages of such veins, as acicular masses and heart-shaped mineral sections 
along shear fabric in the Sadiola Fracture Zone, and as part of the alteration envelope 
surrounding  the  NNE-trending  shears. Tourmaline  grains  either  display  no  chemical 
zoning  or  a  core-and-rim  texture  (Fig. 9A-B). Two  styles  of  occurrence  have  been 
studied under electron microprobe: (a) tourmaline grains orientated parallel to the shear 
fabric in impure carbonate and (b) tourmaline crystals on the selvages of quartz-calcite-
biotite  veins. Electron  probe  micro-analyses  (supplementary  material)  show  that  these 
tourmalines  dominantly  belong  to  the  alkali  group  and  the  schorl-dravite  series, 
similarly to that identified in the Loulo district (Fig. || Within the basal impure carbonates, phlogopite is 
dominant  over  biotite. Muscovite  is  preferentially  developed  instead  of  biotite  in  the 
quartz-feldspar-phyric dikes and commonly occurs in strain shadows with quartz (Fig. 8F). In addition to calcite in the veins, carbonate alteration occurs in a 15-75 m wide zone in 
the greywackes of the immediate hangingwall to the Sadiola Fracture Zone. Texturally-
referred to as “calcite eye bands”, this alteration texture is defined by rounded clots of 
calcite locally stretched along the foliation. The disseminated carbonate spots change to 
intense  pervasive  carbonate  flooding  of  the  greywackes  within  the  Sadiola  Fracture 
Zone. || and  southern  Ghana  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of 
West Africa occurred over a protracted interval between ca. 2100 to 2070 Ma, during a 
period of transcurrent tectonics, soon after the cessation of regional-scale contractional 
deformation  (e.g,  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b;  in  southern 
Mali,  Olson  et  al.,  1992;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011;  in  the  KKI,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a; 
Treloar et al., 2014). At Morila, orogenic gold mineralization has been dated at 2074 ± 
14 Ma (McFarlane et al., 2011: U-Pb on hydrothermal titanite). The structural evolution 
from early fold-and-thrust tectonics to strike-slip tectonics has been described in other 
orogenic belts (e.g. Vassallo and Wilson, 2002; Clegg and Holdsworth, 2005; Ulrich et 
al.,  2011)  and  is  typically  associated  with  gold-forming  events. At  Sadiola  Hill,  the 
Sadiola Fracture Zone was the dominant structure active during mineralization and has 
therefore focused the greatest amount of dilation and permeability.",Sadiola Fracture Zone,llm

Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || 2). Early  F1  folds 
observed  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  and  FE3  open  pits  have  been  refolded  by  F2  creating 
interference patterns (Fig. 3, 4A). The F2 folds are disharmonic with upright to inclined 
fold  hinges. They  are  associated  with  a  015º/75ºE  (e.g. Sadiola  Hill,  Tambali, 
Alamoutala)  to  035º/75ºE  (e.g. || 2160 and 2115 Ma (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo 
and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; McFarlane et al., 2011; in the 
KKI,  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || 3.1.2. Diamond drill core logging 
Drill  core  logging  was  conducted  over  4  weeks  and  included  spatially 
representative  diamond  drill  holes  from  individual  gold  deposits  (i.e. Sadiola  Hill, 
Tambali,  Yatela,  Alamoutala,  KW18,  FE3-North,  FE3-South,  and  FE4). Structural 
measurements  were  collected  using  a  rocket  launcher  device  and/or  using  α-β  angles 
protractors. 3.1.3. Geological sampling 
On the basis of the field observations, 215 samples were collected from outcrop 
in the open pits and diamond drill core. || 3.2. Analytical techniques 
3.2.1. Optical microscopy 
A total of 277 polished thin sections were prepared at the University of Western 
Australia  (UWA)  and  at  Vancouver  Petrographics  Ltd. The  database  included  62 
polished  thin  sections  from  regional  outcrops,  60  from  Sadiola  Hill,  58  from 
Alamoutala,  41  from  Yatela,  10  from  FE3-FE4,  and  14  from  KW18. Transmitted  and 
reflected light optical microscopy was used to investigate rock types, alteration textures 
and intensities, ore mineralogy, and strain fabrics in magmatic and sedimentary rocks of 
the region. Such study took place at the Centre for Exploration Targeting (UWA) and 
enabled prioritisation of samples for higher resolution microscopy. || 5.2. Structural framework 
The  Sadiola  Hill,  Yatela,  and  ancillary  pits  share  a  similar  tectonic  evolution 
(Fig. 2, 3). The data presented hereafter integrates extensive data collected in the open 
pits with data collected from surface outcrop mapping. The earliest structural component (D1s) recorded in the region consists of NNW- to N-
trending  folds. These  folds  are  associated  with  a  weak  to  strong  axial-planar  cleavage 
(S1)  and  a  gently  NNW-plunging  intersection  lineation  (L1)  (Fig. || 7. Discussion 
7.1. Integration  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  with  regional  geology 
and tectonics  
In  this  section,  the  local  deformation  history  identified  at  Sadiola  Hill  is 
compared to the prolonged tectono-magmatic history recorded in other Paleoproterozoic 
greenstone  belts  of  the  West  African  Craton. At  least  two  phases  of  folding  have 
affected  the  country  rocks  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  area. Little  is  known  about  the 
kinematics  of  the  earliest  local  deformation  phase  (D1s),  but  fold  geometry  and 
associated  lineation  data  are  consistent  with  NE-SW-directed  shortening. At  the 
regional  scale,  D1s  is  compatible  with  an  early  deformation  event  (D1)  recorded  in 
southern Mali (Liégeois et al., 1991; McFarlane et al., 2011). || 7.3. Towards a genetic model… 
The Sadiola Hill deposit shares a number of characteristics typical of  orogenic 
gold deposits worldwide (Mikucki and Ridley, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; McCuaig and 
Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Goldfarb et al., 
2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006)  including  a  late-orogenic  relative 
timing,  strong  regional  (i.e.,  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone)  and  local  structural  controls 
(i.e.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  NNE-trending  shear  array)  on  ore  location  and 
geometry,  and  a  pronounced  Au-As-Sb  metal  enrichment  association. The  metal 
enrichment  association  and  geothermometric  estimates  from  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis are compatible with mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-
epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-300°C) conditions in terms of crustal level based on the 
proposed classification of orogenic gold deposits by Groves et al. (1998). However, the 
high  temperature  ore  and  alteration  paragenesis  at  Sadiola  Hill  is  in  thermal 
disequilibrium  with  host  rocks  at  regional  greenschist-facies  conditions,  which  is 
atypical  for  that  class  of  deposit. Such  geological  feature  alone  is  not  diagnostic  of  a 
magmatic fluid source because it can reflect the interaction of a fluid from any source 
with reactive country rocks at a temperature high enough to form stable actinolite and 
biotite  (Ridley  and  Diamond,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). || 9C-D). Zoned tourmalines from the 
veins  display a chemical zoning pattern  that features  a  core-to-rim decrease  in Al  and 
Mg  and  an  increase  in  Fe  and  Ca. They  also  plot  along  the  oxydravite-povondraite 
compositional trend (meta-evaporite tie line) (Fig. 9D). A  final  stage  of  hydrothermal  alteration  recognized  at  Sadiola  Hill  is  associated  with 
normal  displacement  of  the  reactivated  ore-hosting  structures  and  formation  of 
numerous chlorite-calcite-pyrite veins. Based on textural relationships, these veins post-
date the potassic alteration stage and, by implication, the main mineralization phase. || A distinct set of NNE- to NE-trending late diorite dikes (<2 m wide) was identified in 
the  pit  (Fig. 3). Although  no  direct  crosscutting  relationships  could  be  observed  at 
Sadiola Hill, these dikes crosscut the quartz-feldspar-phyric felsic dikes at the Tambali 
ancillary pits, which are situated 2 km southwest of the Sadiola Hill deposit (See Fig. 2). 6.3. Structural setting and geometry 
The  broad  structure  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  open  pit  is  dominated  by  the  N-S  to 
NNW-trending  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  an  array  of  NNE-trending  shears  (Fig. || Chapter II. Sadiola Hill: a world-class carbonate-hosted 
gold deposit in Mali, West Africa. Quentin Masurel1*, Nicolas Thébaud1, John Miller1, Stanislav Ulrich2, Kim A. A. Hein3, Greg

WA, Australia. || Combined  channel  sampling  and  three-dimensional  rendering  of  the  assay 
data under Modelling under Leapfrog® shows that the linkage of steep  NNE-trending 
shears  with  reactivated  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone, 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone, and FE4 Shear Zone) applied a direct control on ore shoot 
geometries in the Sadiola Hill, Alamoutala, FE3, and FE4 gold deposits (Fig. 4E-F). A very late deformation episode (D4s) is associated with a dextral reactivation of earlier 
accretionary  structures. Chlorite-calcite  slickenfibres  on  rare  fault  walls  from  the 
Sadiola  Hill  and Alamoutala  open pits indicate late dextral displacement. Steep NNE-
trending  faults  associated  with  dextral  displacement  have  been  mapped  locally  in 
outcrop  over  the  Finman  plutonic  complex. The  apparent  dextral  offset  of  the  Sadiola 
volcanics in map scale is tentatively associated with D4s. || Fault geometries and kinematic indicators are consistent with 
NNW-SSE-directed shortening. At the regional scale, D3s is compatible with a period of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3)  that  is  coeval  with  local  intrusion  of  ca. 2090  to  2070  Ma

rich granite plutons (Milési et al., 1992; Egal et al., 2002; Schwartz and Melcher, 2004; 
Gueye  et  al.,  2008;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Lawrence  et  al. 2013a;  Lambert-Smith, 
2014). The bulk of the mineralization is constrained to have taken place during D3s at 
Sadiola  Hill. The  similarity  in  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  KKI

Morila gold deposit in southern Mali is constrained to have occurred at 2074 ± 14 Ma 
(hydrothermal  titanite,  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011). In  addition  to  primary  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation, prospectivity in the region is increased due to the exploration potential 
for  Yatela-style  orebodies. Such  orebodies  formed  by  residual  and  supergene  gold 
enrichment processes associated with the development of a deep weathering profile over 
carbonate host rocks. 1.6. Hydrothermal alteration 
Although  gold  deposits  of  the  district  share  equivalent  structural  setting  and 
relative gold timing, the diversity in ore paragenesis, nature and chemistry of wall-rock 
alteration recognised over the camp points toward three distinct styles of mineralisation 
typified by the Sadiola Hill, the Alamoutala, and the Yatela gold deposits (Table 1). The 
typical  gold-related  hydrothermal  alteration  assemblage  in  the  district  is  defined  as 
biotite  +  calcite-dolomite  +  quartz  ±  actinolite-tremolite  ±  muscovite  ±  tourmaline  ± 
pyrite-arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite. || Hill  hydrothermal  system  remains  uncertain. Indeed,  although  a  magmatic  source  is 
indicated at Massawa (Treloar et al., 2014) and may be proposed for Sadiola Hill, gold 
deposits  of  the  Kweke  district  in  the  Archean  Midlands  greenstone  belt  of  Zimbabwe 
are  associated  with  low  salinity,  mixed  aqueous-carbonic  fluid  inclusions  and  stable 
isotope  data  indicating  a  homogeneous  metamorphic  or  mixed  metamorphic  and/or 
magmatic  fluid  source  for  both  the  Au-As  and  the  Au-Sb  mineralization  stages 
(Buchholz et al., 2007). 8. Conclusions 
The  presented  field  and  mineralogical  data  suggest  that  the  Sadiola  Hill 
carbonate-hosted Au-As-Sb mineralization formed during a period of sinistral tectonics 
(i.e. D3s  NNW-SSE  shortening)  that  was  coeval  with  calc-alkaline  magmatic  activity 
between ca. 2090 and 2070 Ma. || Hydrothermal alteration 
Based  on  diagnostic 
textural  and  mineralogical  features,  a  polyphase 
hydrothermal  alteration  history  has  been  identified  at  Sadiola  Hill. An  early  high-
temperature phase is recorded by the porphyroblastic growth of actinolite-tremolite. In 
drill  core,  this  alteration  phase  is  characterised  by  dark  green  clots  and  box-shaped 
spots, millimetric to centimetric in size (≤1 cm). Actinolite-tremolite porphyroblasts are 
locally strongly developed within the Sadiola Fracture Zone and to a lesser extent along 
the  NNE-trending  faults  (Fig. 8A). This  assemblage  has  been  observed  in  silty-
argillaceous interbeds in limestones, in greywackes and as rare occurrences in the early 
diorite. || It is characterized by sinistral 
movement along both the Sadiola Fracture Zone and the NNE-trending shears, synchronous with 
the  potassic  hydrothermal  alteration  stage  and  gold  mineralization. The  latest  recorded  event  is 
associated  with  the  formation  of  WNW-trending  sub-vertical  brittle  cross-faults  that  offset 
mineralization trends. 7.2. Physico-chemical  conditions  of  the  ore-forming  fluid  and 
potential controls on Au-Sb co-precipitation 
The  principal  parameters  that  are  generally  assumed  to  control  ore  mineral 
solubility, other than the activities of the aqueous metallic species, are temperature (T), 
pressure  (P),  oxygen  fugacity  (f02),  pH  and  the  total  sulphur  activity  (Σas)  (Williams-
Jones  and  Normand,  1997). Gold  saturation  and  precipitation  at  Sadiola  Hill  is 
interpreted to have occurred predominantly in response to decompression during brittle-
ductile  failure  and  sulfidation  reactions  during  fluid  -  wall-rock  interaction. The 
extensive brecciation recorded over the best-mineralized drill core intersects illustrates 
the enhanced and cumulative dilation that has developed along the vertical and left-hand 
flexures  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone. || SD1071-285m quartz-feldspar-porphyry: 
Steep NNE-trending  quartz-feldspar-porphyry dykes have been  mapped in the  Sadiola 
Hill and Tambali open pits. The quartz-feldspar-porphyritic dykes are generally 1-2 m 
wide  and  are  spatially  associated  with  NNE-trending  faults  oriented  020º/75ºE. These 
dykes crosscut an early generation of diorite as well as impure carbonates and detrital 
sedimentary rocks in the Sadiola Hill open pit. These dykes were locally folded by F2 
and  boudinaged. They  were  also  sheared  during  subsequent  D3s  deformation  and  host 
mineralisation  at  Sadiola  Hill  and  Tambali. A  least-deformed  and  least-altered  sample 
of quartz-feldspar porphyry was collected from deep diamond drill core at Sadiola Hill. || STA-037 diorite: 
A set of NNE-trending diorite dykes (<2 m wide) was identified in the Sadiola Hill and 
Tambali  open  pits. Although  no  direct  crosscutting  relationships  could  be  observed  at 
Sadiola  Hill,  these  dykes  crosscut  the  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  dykes  at  the  Tambali 
ancillary pits. These diorite dykes are locally affected by F2 folding and display a well-
defined  shear  foliation  marked  by  aligned  sulphides  at  the  Tambali  open  pits. Despite 
extensive weathering conditions due to the shallow level of mining activity at the time 
of fieldwork, a sample was collected from bench walls for geochronology. The rock is 
essentially  composed  of  plagioclase  feldspars  (>80%  modal  vol.)  with  minor  quartz 
(<10%  modal  vol.)  and  green  actinolitic  hornblende  (up  to  6%  modal  vol.). An  older 
population defined by 12 zircons yielded a 207Pb/206Pb weighted mean date of 2161.5 ± 
7 Ma (MSWD = 1.2). || Sadiola  Hill  structural  context:  A)  Interference  pattern  resulting  from  refolding  of

alteration,  and  ore  mineralogy  of  the  world-class  Sadiola  Hill  carbonate-hosted  gold 
deposit. The  documented  results  are  integrated  with  available  data  on  other  gold 
deposits in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier to form the basis of a metallogenic model. The  second  manuscript  (chapter  III)  presents  the  geology,  tectonic  setting,  contact 
metamorphism,  absolute  timing  and  whole  rock  geochemistry  of  the  local  intrusive 
stocks, hydrothermal alteration, and ore mineralogy of the Alamoutala gold deposit. The 
results  are  used  to  discuss  the  possible  links  between  local  magnetite  skarn  formation 
and regional orogenic gold mineralisation in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier. || The  F2  folds  are  associated  with  a  015º/75ºE  (e.g. Sadiola Hill, Tambali, Alamoutala) to 035º/75ºE (e.g. FE3, FE4) axial-planar cleavage 
(S2)  indicative  of  a  WNW  fold  vergence. Fold  axes  and  intersection  lineations  plunge 
gently (15-30°) to the SSW or NNE. A number of NNE-trending thrusts and high-angle 
reverse  faults  are  closely  associated  with  these  F2  folds. Fold  and  fault  geometry,  and 
lineation  data  associated  with  this  second  deformation  event  (D2s)  are  consistent  with 
NW-SE directed shortening. || The  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  shares  a  similar  relative  timing  and 
structural setting to that of other world-class orogenic gold systems in the West African 
Craton  (e.g. Ashanti,  Loulo),  with  gold  deposition  occurring  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent tectonics soon after the cessation of region-wide contractional deformation. The high temperature ore and alteration paragenesis at Sadiola Hill is atypical of gold 
mineralization  in  the  craton  and  indicates  that  the  late  Eburnean  tectono-magmatic 
activity  between  ca. 2090  and  2070  Ma  played  an  important  role  in  the  dynamics  of 
hydrothermal fluid circulation along the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. 2. Introduction 
The  Paleoproterozoic  terranes  of  the  West  African  Craton  host  a  number  of 
world-class gold deposits that are related to orogenic processes associated with the ca. || The  geology  of  the  KKI  differs  from  other  Paleoproterozoic  granite-greenstone 
belts and sedimentary basins by the abundance of carbonate rocks. The Yatela deposit 
occurs within 8 km of the regional-scale Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. Country rocks in the 
Yatela region have been subjected to polycyclic deformation and regional greenschist-
facies metamorphism. A syn-kinematic diorite stock has intruded the metasedimentary 
sequences in the open pit and is associated with a hornblende-hornfels contact aureole. Field relationships and micro-textural data indicate that the primary gold mineralisation 
is  shear-hosted. The  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  Yatela 
primary  gold  mineralisation  and  other  world-class  deposits  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al.,  2014; Sadiola  Hill, Masurel et al., in 
131 || The  geology  of  the  Kofi  basin  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region consists of carbonate and detrital sedimentary rocks that exhibit 
KFMASH assemblages (e.g., biotite, chlorite, muscovite, quartz, K-feldspar) indicative 
of  regional  greenschist-facies  metamorphic  conditions. For  the  purpose  of  clarity,  the 
prefix  “meta”  will  be  omitted  in  the  following  section. Carbonate  rocks  consist  of 
impure  limestones  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  area  and  are  characterised  by  abundant 
thin  (0.2-2  cm)  argillaceous-silty  interbeds. Carbonate  rocks  elsewhere  in  the  region 
consist  of  limestones  locally  interlayered  with  dolomitic  horizons. Meso-scale 
disharmonic slump folds were mapped in carbonate rocks at the Sadiola Hill and FE3 
open pits. The overlying detrital sedimentary rock sequences exhibit way-up indicators 
such  as  fining-upwards  sequences,  scour-and-fill  structures,  and  rare  cross-bedding  in 
sandstone, which altogether indicate a younging to the West. || The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurred  during  D3y  based  on  field  relationships  and 
micro-textural observations. The equivalent structural setting and relative timing of gold 
between Yatela and other world-class gold deposits in the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence 
et  al.,  2013a;  Massawa,  Treloar  et  al.,  2014;  Sadiola  Hill,  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press) 
suggests that region-wide gold mineralisation occurred  during a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics, after the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. Although not 
diagnostic  of  a  specific  fluid  source,  the  chemical  composition  of  syn-mineralisation 
hydrothermal tourmalines at Yatela is also consistent with that reported for Sadiola Hill 
(Masurel et al., in press) and for the Loulo-Bambadji  district (Lawrence  et al., 2013a; 
Lambert-Smith,  2014). At  the  district  scale,  the  primary  ore  paragenesis  at  Yatela  is 
compatible with the Au-As-Sb ± Cu-Ag-W-Mo-Bi-Zn-Pb-Te metal signature identified 
at  Sadiola  Hill  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  presence  of  pyrite  as  principal  sulphide 
phase  at  Yatela,  however,  is  interpreted  to  reflect  a  host-rock  dependency,  and/or  a 
spatial  zoning  of  metals  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone, 
157 || The  second  event  (D2)  is  associated  with  the  formation  of  the  SMSZ  as  a  sinistral 
transpressional  fault  under  NW-SE  directed  shortening  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). Hydrothermal  fluid  flow  and  regional  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  along  the  SMSZ 
(e.g, Loulo, Gounkoto, Sadiola Hill) (Fig. 1) occurred subsequently during the D3 event, 
which marked a switch from a dominantly coaxial system to a non-coaxial deformation 
regime  (Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  last  deformation  event 
(D4)  has  been  locally  reported  in  the  Loulo  deposit  area  and  is  correlated  with  the 
dextral  reactivation  of  the  earlier  accretionary  structures. Available  metamorphic  data 
indicate  regional  peak  metamorphic  conditions  reached  greenschist-facies  (e.g.,  Dia  et 
al.,  1997;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Gueye  et  al.,  2008)  with  local  hornblende-hornfels 
contact  aureoles  surrounding  Eburnean  granitoids  (Debat  et  al.,  1984;  Pawlig  et  al., 
2006; Masurel et al., in press). 134 || The Dialé-Daléma and Kofi 
Series represent the most extensive occurrence of carbonates rocks in the West African 
Craton (Bosse, 1996). The carbonates are locally impure and characterised by abundant 
thin  (0.2-2  cm)  argillaceous-silty  interbeds. Evidence  for  slump  folding  has  been 
observed in the Sadiola Hill and FE3 open pits. In contrast, there is a lack of evidence 
for stromatolitic facies in carbonates of the region, which would reflect shallow water 
conditions. Thus, the deposition of thick carbonate sequences probably occurred in the 
slope and plain of a syn-deformational basin in a convergent setting. Sedimentary rock 
deposition  resulted  from  a  combination  of  abundant  periplatform  and  hemipelagic 
sedimentation  and  rapid  basinal  subsidence  (e.g.,  Sami  and  James,  1994). || The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone acted as the main conduit 
for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa, 
Sadiola  Hill)  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of  West 
Africa  occurred  over  a  protracted  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics,  soon  after  the 
cessation of regional-scale contractional deformation. Despite the uncertainty regarding 
the  source  of  fluids  and  metals  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  hydrothermal  system,  the  late-
Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  activity  reflects  a  transient  geodynamic  process  that  may 
have been critical for orogenic gold mineralization in the region. 60 || The main ore shoots 
plunge  45°S,  indicating  that  mineralization  resulted  from  the  sinistral-normal  linkage 
between the Sadiola Fracture Zone and the NNE-trending shears (Fig. 12). Within the 
KKI, NW-SE shortening in a transpressive regime has similarly been proposed for the 
Kolia-Boboti  sedimentary  basin  (Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012)  and  in  a 
transtensional regime for the Loulo district (Lawrence et al., 2013a). Vein geometry and 
kinematic  indicators  associated  with  the  steep  NE-trending  barren  quartz  veins 
(240°/65°NW)  present  at  Sadiola  Hill  are  consistent  with  a  late  phase  of  NW-SE 
extension (D4s). These veins post-date mineralization. The last local deformation event 
(D5s) is associated with the formation of WNW-trending sub-vertical brittle cross-faults 
(Fig. || and  southern  Ghana  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of 
West Africa occurred over a protracted interval between ca. 2100 to 2070 Ma, during a 
period of transcurrent tectonics, soon after the cessation of regional-scale contractional 
deformation  (e.g,  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b;  in  southern 
Mali,  Olson  et  al.,  1992;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011;  in  the  KKI,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a; 
Treloar et al., 2014). At Morila, orogenic gold mineralization has been dated at 2074 ± 
14 Ma (McFarlane et al., 2011: U-Pb on hydrothermal titanite). The structural evolution 
from early fold-and-thrust tectonics to strike-slip tectonics has been described in other 
orogenic belts (e.g. Vassallo and Wilson, 2002; Clegg and Holdsworth, 2005; Ulrich et 
al.,  2011)  and  is  typically  associated  with  gold-forming  events. At  Sadiola  Hill,  the 
Sadiola Fracture Zone was the dominant structure active during mineralization and has 
therefore focused the greatest amount of dilation and permeability. || metaluminous  plutons  (e.g.,  diorite,  hornblende-biotite-granodiorite)  to  ca  2080-2060 
Ma peraluminous biotite-monzogranites. The  tectonic,  magmatic,  metamorphic  and  hydrothermal  alteration  history  of  the  gold 
deposits in the district is comparable to that of other world-class orogenic gold deposits 
in the KKI. Despite the commonalities, gold mineralisation in the Sadiola-Yatela district 
exhibits  three  distinct  styles  defined  on  the  basis  of  contrasted  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis. The  three gold mineralisation styles  are typified by  the Sadiola Hill-style 
Au-As-Sb  mineralisation,  the  Alamoutala-style  Au-Cu  mineralisation,  and  the  Yatela-
style  auriferous  residuum. The  metal  enrichment  association  and  geothermometric 
estimates from ore and alteration paragenesis at Sadiola Hill are compatible with those 
of mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-
300°C)  orogenic  gold  deposits  worldwide. The  Alamoutala  deposit  represents  two 
distinct  hydrothermal  systems  in  which  a  magnetite-bearing  skarn  developed  locally 
surrounding  syn-kinematic  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks,  and  was  overprinted  by

The Sadiola Hill deposit and satellite occurrences are mined by the Société des 
Mines  d’Or  du  Mali  (SEMOS),  a  joint  venture  between  AngloGold  Ashanti  Limited, 
IAMGold  Corporation,  and  the  government  of  Mali. The  region  displays  widespread 
evidence of ancient and recent artisanal mining, and written records of mining date back 
more  than  300  years  (public  data  from  IAMGOLD  website). However,  the 
development  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  mine  began  in  1992  and  was  based  on  proven  and 
probable reserves amounting to 49.2 Mt of oxide and partly oxidized ore at an average 
grade of 2.86 g/t Au, representing approximately 4.5 Moz (141 t) of contained gold to 
an average depth of 140 m (Boshoff et al., 1998). || 5. Materials and methods 
5.1. Pit mapping, 3D modeling, logging and sampling 
Systematic face mapping was completed on all accessible ramps of the mine at 
the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit. Detailed  section  logging  was  undertaken  and  included  10 
diamond  drill  holes  chosen  to  represent  the  main  structural,  lithological,  and 
mineralogical  variations  observed  in  the  deposit. Petrographic  data  reported  in  this 
paper largely come from drill core samples and, to a lesser extent, from oriented blocks 
sampled directly in the field. All structural readings are given in true north coordinates. || 6.1. Sedimentary rocks 
The geology of the Kofi basin in the Sadiola Hill deposit area consists of impure 
carbonates,  wackes,  and  arenites  to  the  west,  progressing  to  siltstones  and  argillites 
towards  the  east. The  structural  mapping  of  the  open  pit  and  surrounding  outcrops 
provides  evidence  for  complex  folding  and  stacking  of  the  original  strata  during  the 
Eburnean orogeny (Fig. 2). Based on pit mapping and core logging, the lithostratigraphy 
of  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  consists  of  impure  carbonates  overlain  by  younger  detrital 
sedimentary  rocks  (Fig. 3). || Figure  8. Representative  chemical  composition  of  Yatela  syn-mineralisation  stage  hydrothermal

A  refractory  ore  component  has  recently  been  indentified  at  the  Massawa 
orogenic gold deposit (Treloar et al., 2014). Multistage ore development included a low-
grade (<10 g/t) and high-tonnage As-rich sulfide stage, followed by a high-grade (>10 
g/t) and low-tonnage Au-Sb stage. Approximatively 75-90 % of the first stage gold is 
refractory  in  nature  and  occurs  as  solid  solution  gold  in  the  crystal  lattice  of 
disseminated  arsenopyrite  and  pyrite  (Treloar  et  al.,  2014). Laser  ablation  work  was 
undertaken  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  following  the  identification  of  a  similar  ore 
paragenetic sequence to that reported for Massawa. The results were used to assess the 
potential  for  a  refractory  gold  ore  component  and  provide  insights  into  the  chemical 
29 || Scattered and 
variably-oriented sulfide veinlets and stringers comprise the remaining 5 % of the ore. A range of ductile to brittle ore textures is observed at the Sadiola Hill deposit. Brittle 
textures  are  well-developed  in  the  steeply-dipping  segments  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture 
Zone,  whereas  ductile  textures  are  best-observed  in  the  moderately-dipping  segments 
(Fig. 6). The  bedding  angular  relationship  that  is  observed  in  cross-section  between 
footwall  impure  limestones  and  hangingwall  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  corresponds 
with the change in dip of the Sadiola Fracture Zone at depth (Fig. 6). || The  Falémé  belt  (Fig. 1)  consists  of  calc-alkaline  volcaniclastic  rocks,  wackes,  chert, 
manganiferous  shale,  minor  andesitic  lavas,  and  local  rhyolite  flows  (Ndiaye  et  al., 
1997; Hirdes and Davis 2002; Lawrence, 2010). The Falémé belt has been intruded by 
numerous  syn-tectonic,  belt-type,  calc-alkaline  granitoids  (Ndiaye  et  al.,  1997;  Hirdes 
and  Davis,  2002)  such  as  the  Boto  tonalite  dated  at  2082  ±  1  Ma  and  the  Boboti 
granodiorite dated at 2080 ± 1 Ma (Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Pb-Pb zircon). The plutons 
are spatially and genetically associated with iron skarns of the Falémé district (Schwartz 
and Melcher, 2004). The  Kofi  basin,  which  is  host  to  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit,  consists  of  a  sequence  of 
carbonates, wackes, arenites, siltstones, and calcareous clastic rocks (Fig. 1) (Lawrence 
et al., 2013a). || Trace element

The Sadiola Hill deposit is located approximately 425 km northwest of the Mali 
capital Bamako, near the border with Senegal. The terrain surrounding the Sadiola Hill 
gold  mine  is  flat  at  an  average  elevation  of  125  m  above  the  sea  level. The  region  is 
characterized  by  a  thick  subtropical  weathering  profile  that  has  obscured  much  of  the 
surface  geology. Nevertheless,  the  first-order  geological  features  that  characterize  the

pyrrhotite,  pyrite,  native  gold,  aurostibite,  and  a  wide  range  of  accessory  minerals  are 
texturally  associated  with  minerals  precipitated  during  this  phase. The  assemblage  is 
dominated by biotite-(phlogopite), calcite-dolomite, and quartz, with minor tourmaline, 
actinolite-tremolite,  muscovite,  and  K-feldspar,  and  accessory  titanite,  rutile,  apatite, 
and fluorite. Despite the early calc-silicate and the potassic mineral assemblages being 
locally  spatially  associated  and  exhibiting  gradual  to  sharp  alteration  fronts  with  the

suggested the diversity in mineralization styles and ore paragenesis in the KKI resulted

magmatic reservoirs. Such diversity appears to be largely controlled by the distance of 
the  deposits  from  the  regional-scale  lineaments  and  late  Eburnean  syn-kinematic 
intrusions. Yalea-style deposits occur along brittle-ductile shears as far as 8 km from the 
SMSZ and share characteristics typical of Birimian gold mineralization in the Ashanti 
belt of Ghana. In contrast, a magmatic hydrothermal influence has been suggested for 
the  Gara  deposit,  which  occurs  within  2  km  of  the  SMSZ,  and  shows  possible  links

2015_Masurel_phd.txt,"108,237,240,244,32,5,6","1.5. Gold mineralisation 
Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to 
have occurred younger than 2083 ± 7 Ma. || 3. Future work 
Despite  the  work  undertaken  by  the  candidate,  a  number  of  questions  remain 
unanswered, some of which are directly relevant to exploration targeting:  
3.1. Source of fluids and metals 
Recent  research  suggests  that  the  diversity  in  mineralisation  styles  and  ore 
paragenesis  expressed  in  the  KKI  result  from  a  dynamic  hydrothermal  system  that 
sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and magmatic reservoirs (Lawrence 
et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014). The collection and interpretation of fluid inclusion 
and  stable  isotope  data  is  critical  to  establishing  an  ore  genetic  model  for  the  gold 
deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela district. It would also be interesting to see how well the 
orogenic gold paradigm (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2003; 
Goldfarb et al., 2005) translate to accretionary terranes of the West African Craton. 3.2. || Abstract 
The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold 
production 
in 
the  world. The  Kédougou-Kénieba 
inlier  (KKI)  represents 
the 
westernmost  exposure  of  Paleoproterozoic  crust  in  the  West  African  Craton,  with 
outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent 
discoveries  in  the  inlier  have  triggered  a  real  need  for  understanding  the  controls  on 
gold  mineral  system  location  and  ore  shoot  geometry  in  order  to  improve  Brownfield 
and  Greenfield  exploration  strategies. Through  a  multiscale  and  multidisciplinary 
approach  including  structural  geology,  petrography,  geochemistry  and  geochronology, 
this  work  presents  the  first  integrated  study  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  world-class 
Sadiola-Yatela district. || Available 
detrital  zircon  data  from  the  KKI  indicate  that  the  diachroneity  of  magmatic  ages  is 
reflected  in  the  provenance  of  the  sediments. In  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district,  the 
minimum  deposition  age  for  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kofi  Series  correlates  with  the 
emplacement of the Alamoutala plutonic complex at c. 2100 Ma. The prevalence of this 
Bririmian-aged detritus in locally-derived sediments in the district and the KKI suggests 
227 || Deposit-scale investigations indicate that gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela district are 
primarily  hosted  by 
impure  metacarbonates  and, 
to  a 
lesser  extent,  detrital 
metasedimentary  rocks  (e.g.,  wacke,  arenite,  siltstone,  and  argillite)  and  Eburnean 
granitoids. The  presence  of  carbonate  host  rocks  is  very  rare  compared  to  gold 
mineralisation in typical granite-greenstone belts of the West African Craton. Country 
rocks  have  undergone  polycyclic  deformation,  which  included  early  fold-and-thrust 
tectonics  (D1,  D2)  followed  by 
transcurrent 
tectonics  accommodating  oblique 
convergence (D3, D4). The gold deposits of the district share a similar structural setting 
and gold relative timing. District-scale work indicates that orogenic gold mineralisation occured during D3, after 
the cessation of region-wide compressional deformation. Hydrothermal fluid circulation 
was  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  local 
steep NNE-trending shears connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. || Figure 2. Geology of the Sadiola-Yatela district based on AngloGold Ashanti regional map (2014)

Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g.,

rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al.,

known about D1s but the D2s and D3s events were responsible for the formation of map-
scale  structures. The  D2s  and  D3s  events  mark  the  principal  imprint  of  the  Eburnean

The  Paleoproterozoic  terranes  of  West  Africa  provide  a  complete  record  of 
crustal growth. The Kédougou-Kénieba inlier is the westernmost exposure of Birimian 
crust in the West African Craton and a world-class gold gold province. The bulk of the 
orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  inlier  has  been  related  to  a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics coeval with calc-alkaline magmatism in the late Eburnean (ca. 2090 and 2070 
Ma). In this study, the geology, structural framework, geochemistry (n=28) and focused 
geochronology (n=13) of representative magmatic rocks from the Sadiola-Yatela region 
are  presented  and  integrated  with  published  data  in  order  to  provide  the  tectono-

emplacement of most granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. 2115 
and 2060 Ma, which is the best time estimate for the Eburnean orogeny in the KKI. The 
iron skarns of the Falémé district formed post-peak metamorphism at ca. 2080 Ma and 
are  spatially  and  genetically  associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons  such  as  the

gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela region and other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014) suggests that gold mineralisation 
occurred  subsequently  during  a  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics  that  outlasted 
emplacement  of  the  peraluminous  high-K  granites,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional  deformation. It  is  likely  that  the  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity

mineral assemblage) are restricted to contact aureoles surrounding Eburnean granitoids. All  gold  deposits  of  the  district  are  unmetamorphosed. Regional  peak  metamorphism 
pre-dated  the  late  Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  event  that  occurred  between  2090  and 
2060 Ma. 1.4. Magmatism 
The emplacement of most exposed granitoids in the Sadiola-Yatela region took 
place within a short time span between ca. || Saraya-type monzogranites. The evolution from metaluminous to peraluminous magmas 
in the Sadiola-Yatela region was probably related to the fractionation of hydrous melts 
at  increasing  pressure  without  crustal  contamination  (e.g.,  Richards,  2011;  Loucks, 
2014). The  evolution  from  primitive  island  arc  granitoids  to  evolved  peraluminous  granitic 
melts  observed  in  the  KKI  is  analogous  to  that  of  modern  active  margins  (e.g.,  Gill, 
1981). This is supported by findings from Ganne et al. (2011) who recorded evidence 
for blueschist metamorphism in the ca. 2200-2000 Ma rocks of West Africa, suggesting 
that subduction was at play in the Paleoproterozoic era. || Table 3. Summary U-Pb ages of igneous rocks from the Sadiola-Yatela region

proposed  by  Lambert-Smith  et  al. (in  press)  to  allow  garnet  to  become  stable  in  the

peraluminous  biotite-granites  from  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  are  distinct  from  the 
213 || The  geology  of  the  Kofi  basin  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region consists of carbonate and detrital sedimentary rocks that exhibit 
KFMASH assemblages (e.g., biotite, chlorite, muscovite, quartz, K-feldspar) indicative 
of  regional  greenschist-facies  metamorphic  conditions. For  the  purpose  of  clarity,  the 
prefix  “meta”  will  be  omitted  in  the  following  section. Carbonate  rocks  consist  of 
impure  limestones  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  area  and  are  characterised  by  abundant 
thin  (0.2-2  cm)  argillaceous-silty  interbeds. Carbonate  rocks  elsewhere  in  the  region 
consist  of  limestones  locally  interlayered  with  dolomitic  horizons. Meso-scale 
disharmonic slump folds were mapped in carbonate rocks at the Sadiola Hill and FE3 
open pits. The overlying detrital sedimentary rock sequences exhibit way-up indicators 
such  as  fining-upwards  sequences,  scour-and-fill  structures,  and  rare  cross-bedding  in 
sandstone, which altogether indicate a younging to the West. || The identified deformation history is consistent with 
available  structural  data  for  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Gueye  et  al.,  2008;  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010; 
Diene et al, 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). At least two episodes of 
folding  have  been  identified  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region. Early  F1  folds  are 
disharmonic  with  recumbent  to  inclined  fold  hinges. These  folds  are  NNW-  to  N-
trending,  gently  south-dipping  (10°-30°),  and  associated  with  a  weak  to  strong  axial-
planar  cleavage  (S1). Fold  geometry  and  lineation  data  associated  with  this  early 
deformation  event  (D1s)  are  consistent  with  WSW-ENE-directed  to  E-W-directed 
shortening. These  early  F1  folds  are  refolded  by  F2  disharmonic  folds  associated  with 
upright  to  inclined  fold  hinges. || These  rocks  have  a  calc-alkaline  affinity  and  are 
characterised  by  negative  Nb-Ta  anomalies,  marked  Pb  positive  anomalies  and  high 
LIL/HFS  ratios. Such  characteristics  are  compatible  with  distinctive  features  of 
subduction  zone  magmatism  in  modern-day  active  continental  margin  context  (e.g., 
Hawkesworth  and  Kemp,  2006;  Moyen  and  Martin,  2012). The  Fe*  values  associated 
with  magmatic  rocks  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  reflect  a  close  affinity  to  relatively 
hydrous, oxidised magmas and source regions (e.g., Frost and Lindsley, 1991), which is 
compatible  with  arc  magmas  (e.g.,  Richards,  2011). The  hydrous  nature  of  these 
Eburnean magmatic rocks is supported by the abundance of magmatic hornblende and 
biotite  (e.g.,  Ridolfi  et  al.,  2010). The  relatively  high  magmatic  oxidation  states  are 
reflected  by  the  stability  of  titanite  in  a  large  number  of  these  volcanic  and  plutonic 
rocks (e.g., Foley and Wheller, 1990). It cannot be excluded, however, that these trace 
element signatures may have been inherited (i.e. || lithospheric-scale  processes  (e.g.,  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006;  McCuaig  et  al.,  2010). Recent 
research in the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between late Eburnean calc-
alkaline plutons and gold mineralisation (Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014; 
Lambert-Smith, 2014; Masurel et al., in press a, b). The potential role a complex fluid 
history  involving  metamorphic  and  magmatic  sources  has  been  proposed  in  the 
development  of  major  gold  deposits  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a,b;  Massawa, 
Treloar  et  al.,  2014). The  late  Eburnean  magmatic  activity  has  also  been  proposed  to 
have participated in the generation of thermal gradients, which produced regional fluid 
systems capable of transpoting gold (e.g., Masurel et al., in press a,.b). Regardless of the 
variability in gold mineralisation at the deposit-scale, the late Ebrunean tectono-thermal 
event  may  represent 
the  geodynamic  engine 
that  empowered  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation  in  the  KKI. This  study  aims  at  (i)  documenting  the  petrographical-
geochemical  characteristics  and  absolute  timing  of  representative  igneous  rocks  in  the 
Sadiola-Yatela region and (ii) placing these rocks into a regional geological framework

display a similar evolution from calc-alkaline metaluminous diorite-granodiorite plutons 
to peraluminous high-K granites (e.g., Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye 
et  al.,  2008). Geochronological  data  also  shows  the  syn-volcanic  nature  of  Eburnean 
plutonism. Field relationships and geochronology data indicate that sediment deposition

magmatic  ages  is  reflected  in  the  provenance  of  the  sediments,  which  further 
strengthened  the  hypothesis  that  the  Kofi  and  Dialé-Daléma  represented  syn-
deformational  basins  in  a  convergent  setting. The  evolution  from  fold-and-thrust 
tectonics  to  transcurrent  tectonics  identified  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  has  similarly 
been  proposed  for  the  Mako  area  (Diene  et  al.,  2012)  and  the  Loulo  area  (Dabo  and

which suggests that the Dialé-Daléma and Kofi sequences represent rocks deposited in 
syn-deformational foreland basins. Rocks of the sedimentary basins and volcanic belts 
were intruded by different generations of syn-tectonic, calc-alkaline plutons during the 
Eburnean  orogeny  between  ca. 2115  and  2070  Ma. These  granitoids  include 
metaluminous hornblende-biotite-bearing diorite to granodiorite (e.g., Mamakono, 2076 
± 3 Ma, Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Tinkoto, 2074 ± 5 Ma, Gueye et al., 2007), pyroxene-
bearing granodiorite-tonalite (e.g., Boboti, 2080 ± 1 Ma, Hirdes and Davis, 2002), and 
peraluminous monzogranites (e.g., Saraya, 2079 ± 2 Ma, Hirdes and Davis, 2002) (Fig. 1). Available  geochronological  data  suggest  that  the  emplacement  of  most  Eburnean 
granitoids took place within a short time span between ca. || 13). The  general  concave-down  pattern  from  the  MORB  field  to 
upper continental crust compositions reflects a differentiation trend with amphibole as a 
major mineral phase control (fractionated or residual). The relative scatter in the field of 
Eburnean granitoids likely reflects variable incorporation of sedimentary material. This 
is  compatible  with  the  fact  that  magmas  in  more  mature  arcs  typically  stall  at  density 
barriers  in  the  mantle  or  at  one  or  more  levels  in  the  crust,  where  they  undergo  wall-
rock  assimilation  and  fractionated  crystallisation  (e.g.,  De  Paolo,  1981),  or  MASH 
(melting,  assimilation,  storage,  homogenisation)  processes  (e.g.,  Annen  et  al.,  2006). The late Eburnean peraluminous high-K granites (e.g., Saraya, Gamaye) plot to the far 
right  of  the  diagram,  suggesting  the  presence  of  garnet  in  deep  residual  sources  and 
crustal  contamination  (Fig. 13). || Detrital  zircons  from  a  quartz  wacke  in  the  Dialé-Daléma  basin  indicate  a 
uniform  age  of  2165  ±  1  Ma  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Pb-Pb  zircon)  for  the  source 
material. Rocks  of  the  Dialé-Daléma  Series  are  intruded  by  the  peraluminous,  K-rich 
Saraya  granite,  which  has  been  dated  at  2079  ±  2  Ma  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  U-Pb

with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; McFarlane et al., 2011; in the 
KKI,  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Treloar  et  al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is inferred to have formed 
as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || 7.3. Towards a genetic model… 
The Sadiola Hill deposit shares a number of characteristics typical of  orogenic 
gold deposits worldwide (Mikucki and Ridley, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; McCuaig and 
Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Goldfarb et al., 
2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006)  including  a  late-orogenic  relative 
timing,  strong  regional  (i.e.,  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone)  and  local  structural  controls 
(i.e.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  NNE-trending  shear  array)  on  ore  location  and 
geometry,  and  a  pronounced  Au-As-Sb  metal  enrichment  association. The  metal 
enrichment  association  and  geothermometric  estimates  from  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis are compatible with mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-
epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-300°C) conditions in terms of crustal level based on the 
proposed classification of orogenic gold deposits by Groves et al. (1998). However, the 
high  temperature  ore  and  alteration  paragenesis  at  Sadiola  Hill  is  in  thermal 
disequilibrium  with  host  rocks  at  regional  greenschist-facies  conditions,  which  is 
atypical  for  that  class  of  deposit. Such  geological  feature  alone  is  not  diagnostic  of  a 
magmatic fluid source because it can reflect the interaction of a fluid from any source 
with reactive country rocks at a temperature high enough to form stable actinolite and 
biotite  (Ridley  and  Diamond,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005). || Deposit-scale investigations indicate that gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela district are 
primarily  hosted  by 
impure  metacarbonates  and, 
to  a 
lesser  extent,  detrital 
metasedimentary  rocks  (e.g.,  wacke,  arenite,  siltstone,  and  argillite)  and  Eburnean 
granitoids. The  presence  of  carbonate  host  rocks  is  very  rare  compared  to  gold 
mineralisation in typical granite-greenstone belts of the West African Craton. Country 
rocks  have  undergone  polycyclic  deformation,  which  included  early  fold-and-thrust 
tectonics  (D1,  D2)  followed  by 
transcurrent 
tectonics  accommodating  oblique 
convergence (D3, D4). The gold deposits of the district share a similar structural setting 
and gold relative timing. District-scale work indicates that orogenic gold mineralisation occured during D3, after 
the cessation of region-wide compressional deformation. Hydrothermal fluid circulation 
was  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  local 
steep NNE-trending shears connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. || Fold and fault geometries, and kinematic 
indicators  are  consistent  with  progressive  NW-SE-directed  shortening. The  following 
D3  event  is  associated  with  the  strike-slip  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures 
and  the  formation  of  steep  NNE-trending  sinistral  shear  zones  (Diene  et  al.,  2012; 
Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  a,  b). Fault  geometries  and  kinematic 
indicators  are  consistent  with  NNW-SSE-directed  shortening. The  D2  and  D3  events 
documented  in  the  KKI  relate  to  the  evolution  of  a  regional  system  accommodating 
oblique  convergence  during  the  Eburnean  orogeny  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press  a). The 
Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  the  Main  Transcurrent  Zone  are  interpreted  to  have 
formed during the onset of D2 as transpressional shear zones (Fig. 1) (Lawrence et al., 
2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). || Hill,  Tambali,  Yatela,  Alamoutala,  KW18,  FE3-North,  FE3-South,  and  FE4)  and  a 
representative coverage of the surface outcrops in the region. Systematic face mapping 
was done on most accessible ramps of the open pits with a particular emphasis on the 
relationship  between  deformation,  magmatism,  hydrothermal  alteration  and  gold 
mineralisation. 3D geological modelling was performed ahead of the field investigation 
using Leapfrog® Mining and refined with advancing mapping. The trends of ore shoots 
in the orebodies were evaluated using three-dimensional rendering of grade control and 
exploration  drill-hole  assay  data. In  addition  to  the  open  pit  mapping  exercise,  five 
regional  mapping  transects  were  undertaken  using  of  a  rugged  tablet  containing 
geophysical data such as magnetics and radiometrics under ArcGIS. Two transects were 
undertaken  across  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  from  East  to  West  and  two  transects 
investigated  sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Kofi  basin  all  the  way  to  the  escarpment  of 
Neoproterozoic cover. || Obolensky  et  al. (2009) 
suggested  that  the  physico-chemical  parameters  of  ore-forming  fluids  associated  with 
Au-As-Sb  deposits  indicate  deep  circulation  of  hydrothermal  solutions,  which  make 
them in disequilibrium with country rocks at the ore deposition level. The late orogenic 
switch  from  fold-and-thrust  tectonics  to  strike-slip  tectonics  along  the  Senegal-Mali 
Shear  Zone  most  likely  promoted  high  fluid  flow  and  the  arrival  of  magmatic  fluids 
with minor heat loss at upper crustal levels, which is consistent with the occurrence of 
voluminous  calc-alkaline  magmatism  at  ca. 2090-2070  Ma. The  high  temperature  ore 
and alteration paragenesis is therefore suggested to represent a transient thermal effect 
associated with syn-kinematic igneous activity at the time of mineralization. Based on 
this study and recent research by Lawrence et al. || Regional geology

most extensive carbonate exposure in the Birimian of West Africa (Fig. 1) (Bosse et al.,

structural setting to that of other world-class orogenic gold systems in the West African 
Craton  (e.g. Ashanti,  Loulo),  with  gold  deposition  occurring  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent tectonics soon after the cessation of region-wide contractional deformation. The high temperature ore and alteration paragenesis at Sadiola Hill is atypical of gold 
mineralization  in  the  craton  and  indicates  that  the  late  Eburnean  tectono-magmatic 
activity  between  ca. 2090  and  2070  Ma  played  an  important  role  in  the  dynamics  of 
hydrothermal fluid circulation along the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. 2. Introduction 
The  Paleoproterozoic  terranes  of  the  West  African  Craton  host  a  number  of 
world-class gold deposits that are related to orogenic processes associated with the ca. || The  geology  of  the  KKI  differs  from  other  Paleoproterozoic  granite-greenstone 
belts and sedimentary basins by the abundance of carbonate rocks. The Yatela deposit 
occurs within 8 km of the regional-scale Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. Country rocks in the 
Yatela region have been subjected to polycyclic deformation and regional greenschist-
facies metamorphism. A syn-kinematic diorite stock has intruded the metasedimentary 
sequences in the open pit and is associated with a hornblende-hornfels contact aureole. Field relationships and micro-textural data indicate that the primary gold mineralisation 
is  shear-hosted. The  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  Yatela 
primary  gold  mineralisation  and  other  world-class  deposits  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Loulo,

131 || The  polycyclic  deformation  recorded  in  sedimentary  and  magmatic 
rocks of the region includes a period of early convergence (D1s), followed by a period of 
fold-and-thrust tectonics (D2s), and later transcurrent tectonics (D3s-D4s). The bulk of the 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occured  during  D3s,  with  sinistral  displacement  and 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  steep  NNE-
trending shear zones connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. The  results  of  this  study,  when  integrated  with  published  data,  indicate  that  the  late 
Eburnean  tectono-thermal  event  between  2080  and  2060  Ma  represented  the 
geodynamic  engine  that  empowered  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Kédougou-
Kénieba  inlier. The  new  data  also  further  supports  the  hypothesis  that  the  Eburnean 
tectono-magmatic activity affected the Baoulé-Mossi domain diachronously from SE to 
NW. 2. Introduction 
  Paleoproterozoic  supracrustal  and  intrusive  rocks  in  the  West  African  Craton 
mark a major episode of juvenile crust growth that lasted ~175 Ma from ca. || The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurred  during  D3y  based  on  field  relationships  and 
micro-textural observations. The equivalent structural setting and relative timing of gold 
between Yatela and other world-class gold deposits in the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence 
et  al.,  2013a;  Massawa,  Treloar  et  al.,  2014;  Sadiola  Hill,  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press) 
suggests that region-wide gold mineralisation occurred  during a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics, after the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. Although not 
diagnostic  of  a  specific  fluid  source,  the  chemical  composition  of  syn-mineralisation 
hydrothermal tourmalines at Yatela is also consistent with that reported for Sadiola Hill 
(Masurel et al., in press) and for the Loulo-Bambadji  district (Lawrence  et al., 2013a; 
Lambert-Smith,  2014). At  the  district  scale,  the  primary  ore  paragenesis  at  Yatela  is 
compatible with the Au-As-Sb ± Cu-Ag-W-Mo-Bi-Zn-Pb-Te metal signature identified 
at  Sadiola  Hill  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  presence  of  pyrite  as  principal  sulphide 
phase  at  Yatela,  however,  is  interpreted  to  reflect  a  host-rock  dependency,  and/or  a 
spatial  zoning  of  metals  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone, 
157 || The D3 event has been correlated with hydrothermal fluid 
flow  and  gold  mineralisation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  the  Main 
Transcurrent Zone (Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014; Masurel et al., in press 
a, b, c). A last deformation event (D4) has been locally reported for the Loulo region and 
is  correlated  with  the  formation  of  NW-trending  z-shaped  folds  and  the  dextral 
reactivation of the N- to NNE-trending structural corridors (Dabo and Aïfa, 2011). This 
very  late  deformation  episode  occurred  between  ca. 2075  and  2050  Ma  under  E-W  to 
NE-SW-directed shortening (Dabo and Aïfa, 2011). 179 || The Senegal-Mali Shear Zone acted as the main conduit 
for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa, 
Sadiola  Hill)  suggests  that  gold  mineralization  within  the  Birimian  terranes  of  West 
Africa  occurred  over  a  protracted  period  of  transcurrent  tectonics,  soon  after  the 
cessation of regional-scale contractional deformation. Despite the uncertainty regarding 
the  source  of  fluids  and  metals  for  the  Sadiola  Hill  hydrothermal  system,  the  late-
Eburnean  tectono-magmatic  activity  reflects  a  transient  geodynamic  process  that  may 
have been critical for orogenic gold mineralization in the region. 60 || The bulk of 
the gold mineralisation in the region occured during D3s, with sinistral displacement and 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  steep  NNE-
trending shear zones connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. The Senegal-Mali 
Shear  Zone,  however,  does  not  correlate  in  the  field  with  a  continuous  crustal-scale 
structure  (e.g.,  Bassot  and  Dommanget,  1986;  Ledru  et  al.,  1991). In  contrast,  the 
Senegal-Mali Shear Zone is represented by alterning high strain and low strain domains 
separating  two  distinct  volcanic  and  sedimentary  lithostratigraphic  domains  that  occur 
at similar metamorphic grades. Within the high strain domains, microtectonic evidence 
such  as  stretched  porphyroclasts  and  symmetrical  strain  shadows  indicate  a  dominant 
component of flattening (i.e. pure shear deformation). Such results are consistent with 
the  interpretation  that  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  formed  as  a  transpressional  fault

discontinuities, respectively the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone and Main Transcurrent Zone. A  number  of  world-class  mining  districts  are  located  along  these  highly  prospective

facies conditions and the higher temperature of the ore-related hydrothermal alteration

associated  with  syn-kinematic  igneous  activity  in  the  region  at  the  time  of 
mineralisation  (i.e. late  Eburnean  tectono-thermal  event). The  contrasted  primary  ore

Gold  mineralisation  is  largely  hosted  by  metacarbonates  in  the  district  (e.g., 
Sadiola  Hill,  Alamoutala,  Yatela,  FE3)  but  also  occurs  in  detrital  metasedimentary 
rocks (e.g., Tambali, FE4, KW18) and plutonic rocks (e.g., Alamoutala, Sadiola Hill). The 
late-Eburnean  sinistral  reactivation  of  early  accretionary  structures  (e.g., 
lithostratigraphic interfaces, S1, Sadiola Fracture Zone) and coupling/linkage with steep 
NNE-trending  shears  was  critical  to  ore  location  and  geometry. Lithological  contacts 
with  contrasting  competency  properties  and  low  mean  stress  areas  surrounding  rigid 
granitoid bodies were critical to hydrothermal fluid flow focussing. The similar relative 
timing  and  structural  setting  between  gold  deposits  of  the  Sadiola-Yatela  district  and 
other deposits of the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 
2014)  indicates  that  gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent  tectonics  (D3),  after  the  cessation  of  regional  contractional  deformation 
(D1-D2). Orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  is  constrained  to

exploration  drill-hole  assay  data. In  addition  to  the  open  pit  mapping  exercise,  five 
regional  mapping  transects  were  undertaken  using  of  a  rugged  tablet  containing 
geophysical data such as magnetics and radiometrics under ArcGIS. Two transects were 
undertaken  across  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  from  East  to  West  and  two  transects

dykes crosscut an early generation of diorite as well as impure carbonates and detrital 
sedimentary rocks in the Sadiola Hill open pit. These dykes were locally folded by F2

The  Paleoproterozoic  terranes  of  West  Africa  provide  a  complete  record  of 
crustal growth. The Kédougou-Kénieba inlier is the westernmost exposure of Birimian 
crust in the West African Craton and a world-class gold gold province. The bulk of the 
orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  inlier  has  been  related  to  a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics coeval with calc-alkaline magmatism in the late Eburnean (ca. 2090 and 2070 
Ma). In this study, the geology, structural framework, geochemistry (n=28) and focused 
geochronology (n=13) of representative magmatic rocks from the Sadiola-Yatela region 
are  presented  and  integrated  with  published  data  in  order  to  provide  the  tectono-
magmatic framework to gold mineralisation in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier. The  granitoids  from  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  display  a  temporal  evolution  from  ca. || Bassot,  J.P.,  and  Caen-Vachette,  M.,  1984,  Données  géochronologiques  et  géochimiques

Paleoproterozoic  (i.e. Birimian)  volcano-plutonic  belts  and  sedimentary  basins 
of  West  Africa  not  only  provide  a  complete  record  of  crustal  growth  but  also  host  a 
number of world-class  gold  deposits  (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher  et al., 1992). To 
date, a large number of studies have focused on the Baoulé-Mossi domain, which covers 
portions  of  Burkina  Faso,  Côte  d’Ivoire,  Ghana,  Guinea  and  Mali  (Fig. 1). || Chapter II. Sadiola Hill: a world-class carbonate-hosted

and  2125  ±  8  Ma  (Calvez  et  al.,  1990;  Pb-Pb  zircon). The  peraluminous  Gamaye 
leucogranite that intruded the Kofi sediments has been dated at 2045 ± 27 Ma (Bassot 
and Caen-Vachette, 1984; Rb-Sr on whole rock). Birimian rocks of the KKI have undergone polycyclic deformation. Early phases 
of fold-and-thrust tectonics (D1-D2) linked to initial accretion are followed by a period 
of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa, 
2010, 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). A similar 
polyphase character has been reported in other Birimian terranes of West Africa (e.g., in 
Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,  Hein,  2010;  in

Ghana, Feybesse et al., 2006; in Burkina Faso, Baratoux et al., 2011). The SMSZ and

The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West 
African Craton (e.g., Ashanti, Morila) (Oberthür et al., 1998; Allibone et al., 2002a, b; 
Feybesse et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2011; Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al.,

interpreted to have formed during a period of region-wide orogenic gold (e.g., Groves et 
al., 1998; McCuaig and Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Groves et al., 2003; 
Goldfarb et al., 2005) mineralisation in the late Eburnean, similarly to world-class and 
minor gold deposits in the KKI. The bulk of the resource at Yatela, however, is hosted in the auriferous residuum and is 
associated  with  irregular  (e.g.,  dendritic  to  wire-like  forms),  angular  secondary  gold 
grains (Hein et al., in press). Such morphology is interpreted to result from mobilisation 
(physical  and/or  chemical)  of  the  locally-sourced  primary  (hypogene)  gold  during  the 
creation  of  a  deep  weathering  profile  and  associated  karstification  processes  (e.g., 
Bowell  et  al.,  1996). The  creation  of  a  deep  weathering  profile  was  initiated  in  the 
upper-Cretaceous  across  West  Africa  (e.g.,  Brown  et  al.,  1994;  Lavaud  et  al.,  2004). The surficial dissolution of the carbonate host rocks resulted in the creation of troughs 
that  were  draped  and  filled  with  a  ferruginous  dissolution  residue  locally  containing 
secondary gold (e.g., Hein et al., in press) and blocks of Neoproterozoic sandstone that 
are  likely  to  have  collapsed  into  the  Yatela  depocentre  because  karstification  started 
beneath  the  cover  sequences  (Fig. || belt (eastern Senegal, West Africa). International Journal of Geosciences 3, 153-

Despite  the  work  undertaken  by  the  candidate,  a  number  of  questions  remain 
unanswered, some of which are directly relevant to exploration targeting:  
3.1. Source of fluids and metals 
Recent  research  suggests  that  the  diversity  in  mineralisation  styles  and  ore 
paragenesis  expressed  in  the  KKI  result  from  a  dynamic  hydrothermal  system  that 
sourced fluids and metals from both metamorphic and magmatic reservoirs (Lawrence 
et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 2014). The collection and interpretation of fluid inclusion 
and  stable  isotope  data  is  critical  to  establishing  an  ore  genetic  model  for  the  gold 
deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela district. It would also be interesting to see how well the 
orogenic gold paradigm (Groves et al., 1998; Goldfarb et al., 2001; Groves et al., 2003; 
Goldfarb et al., 2005) translate to accretionary terranes of the West African Craton. 3.2. || 3.2. Sedimentary basins

greenstone  belts  of  the  West  African  Craton. At  least  two  phases  of  folding  have 
affected  the  country  rocks  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  area. Little  is  known  about  the 
kinematics  of  the  earliest  local  deformation  phase  (D1s),  but  fold  geometry  and 
associated  lineation  data  are  consistent  with  NE-SW-directed  shortening. At  the 
regional  scale,  D1s  is  compatible  with  an  early  deformation  event  (D1)  recorded  in 
southern Mali (Liégeois et al., 1991; McFarlane et al., 2011). || Abstract 
The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold 
production 
in 
the  world. The  Kédougou-Kénieba 
inlier  (KKI)  represents 
the 
westernmost  exposure  of  Paleoproterozoic  crust  in  the  West  African  Craton,  with 
outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent 
discoveries  in  the  inlier  have  triggered  a  real  need  for  understanding  the  controls  on 
gold  mineral  system  location  and  ore  shoot  geometry  in  order  to  improve  Brownfield 
and  Greenfield  exploration  strategies. Through  a  multiscale  and  multidisciplinary 
approach  including  structural  geology,  petrography,  geochemistry  and  geochronology, 
this  work  presents  the  first  integrated  study  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  world-class 
Sadiola-Yatela district. || Abstract 
The  Paleoproterozoic  terranes  of  West  Africa  provide  a  complete  record  of 
crustal growth. The Kédougou-Kénieba inlier is the westernmost exposure of Birimian 
crust in the West African Craton and a world-class gold gold province. The bulk of the 
orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  inlier  has  been  related  to  a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics coeval with calc-alkaline magmatism in the late Eburnean (ca. 2090 and 2070 
Ma). In this study, the geology, structural framework, geochemistry (n=28) and focused 
geochronology (n=13) of representative magmatic rocks from the Sadiola-Yatela region 
are  presented  and  integrated  with  published  data  in  order  to  provide  the  tectono-
magmatic framework to gold mineralisation in the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier. The  granitoids  from  the  Sadiola-Yatela  region  display  a  temporal  evolution  from  ca. || All  structural  readings  are  given  in  true  north  coordinates. Planar 
features are given in strike/dip/quadrant and linear data is given as plunge and azimuth. In  this  paper,  the  “y”  subscript  indicates  that  the  considered  structural  event  is  only 
valid  for  the  Yatela  district,  which  may  differ  from  regional  structural  compilations 
reported  for  the  West  African  Craton. The  trends  of  ore  shoots  were  evaluated  using 
Leapfrog® three-dimensional rendering of combined grade control and exploration drill 
hole assay data. 4.2. Petrography and mineral chemistry 
Fifty samples were collected from diamond drill core and directly in the Yatela 
open pit. || Deposit-scale investigations indicate that gold deposits of the Sadiola-Yatela district are 
primarily  hosted  by 
impure  metacarbonates  and, 
to  a 
lesser  extent,  detrital 
metasedimentary  rocks  (e.g.,  wacke,  arenite,  siltstone,  and  argillite)  and  Eburnean 
granitoids. The  presence  of  carbonate  host  rocks  is  very  rare  compared  to  gold 
mineralisation in typical granite-greenstone belts of the West African Craton. Country 
rocks  have  undergone  polycyclic  deformation,  which  included  early  fold-and-thrust 
tectonics  (D1,  D2)  followed  by 
transcurrent 
tectonics  accommodating  oblique 
convergence (D3, D4). The gold deposits of the district share a similar structural setting 
and gold relative timing. District-scale work indicates that orogenic gold mineralisation occured during D3, after 
the cessation of region-wide compressional deformation. Hydrothermal fluid circulation 
was  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  local 
steep NNE-trending shears connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. || Evolution  of  a  Paleoproterozoic  “weak  type”  orogeny  in  the  West  African

deposits  of  various  types  have  been  recognised  in  these  Birimian  belts  and  include 
orogenic  gold  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b),  intrusion-related  gold  (e.g., 
Morila, McFarlane et al., 2011; Hammond et al., 2011), Cu-Au porphyry (e.g., Gaoua, 
public data from AMIRA International West African Initiative final report, 2013), and 
paleoplacer  (e.g.,  Tarkwa,  Pigois  et  al.,  2003). Detailed  deposit-scale  studies,  which 
integrated  structural-metamorphic-hydrothermal  data  with  high  precision  isotopic 
dating,  have  also  shown  evidence  for  distinct  gold  mineralisation  pulses  (e.g.,  2191-
2158 Ma gold at Wassa, Parra-Avila, in press; 2105 ± 2 Ma gold at Ashanti, Oberthür et 
al.,  1998;  2063  ±  9  Ma  gold  at  Damang,  Pigois  et  al.,  2003). Nevertheless,  the  vast 
majority  of  world-class  gold  deposits  in  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  belong  to  the

provides  a  new  appreciation  for  the  economic  interest  of  Yatela-style  orebodies  and 
their prospectivity in other gold provinces of the West African Craton where carbonates 
are  present,  such  as  in  the  Siguiri  basin  in  Guinea  and  the  Ity  region  in  western  Côte 
d’Ivoire. 2. Introduction 
The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West 
African Craton (e.g., Ashanti, Morila) (Oberthür et al., 1998; Allibone et al., 2002a, b; 
Feybesse et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2011; Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). || The  polycyclic  deformation  recorded  in  sedimentary  and  magmatic 
rocks of the region includes a period of early convergence (D1s), followed by a period of 
fold-and-thrust tectonics (D2s), and later transcurrent tectonics (D3s-D4s). The bulk of the 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  region  occured  during  D3s,  with  sinistral  displacement  and 
hydrothermal  fluid  circulation  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and  steep  NNE-
trending shear zones connected to structural traps in the Kofi basin. The  results  of  this  study,  when  integrated  with  published  data,  indicate  that  the  late 
Eburnean  tectono-thermal  event  between  2080  and  2060  Ma  represented  the 
geodynamic  engine  that  empowered  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the  Kédougou-
Kénieba  inlier. The  new  data  also  further  supports  the  hypothesis  that  the  Eburnean 
tectono-magmatic activity affected the Baoulé-Mossi domain diachronously from SE to 
NW. 2. Introduction 
  Paleoproterozoic  supracrustal  and  intrusive  rocks  in  the  West  African  Craton 
mark a major episode of juvenile crust growth that lasted ~175 Ma from ca. || The Dialé-Daléma and Kofi 
Series represent the most extensive occurrence of carbonates rocks in the West African 
Craton (Bosse, 1996). The carbonates are locally impure and characterised by abundant 
thin  (0.2-2  cm)  argillaceous-silty  interbeds. Evidence  for  slump  folding  has  been 
observed in the Sadiola Hill and FE3 open pits. In contrast, there is a lack of evidence 
for stromatolitic facies in carbonates of the region, which would reflect shallow water 
conditions. Thus, the deposition of thick carbonate sequences probably occurred in the 
slope and plain of a syn-deformational basin in a convergent setting. Sedimentary rock 
deposition  resulted  from  a  combination  of  abundant  periplatform  and  hemipelagic 
sedimentation  and  rapid  basinal  subsidence  (e.g.,  Sami  and  James,  1994). || The polycyclic 
deformation  history  recorded  in  the  KKI  is  similar  to  that  reported  at  the  scale  of  the 
West African Craton (In Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et al., 2009; in Burkina 
Faso, Hein, 2010; Baratoux et al., 2011; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in 
southern Mali, Liégeois et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Olson et al., 1992; McFarlane 
et al., 2011; in southern Ghana, Allibone et al., 2002a, b). As for the KKI, the bulk of 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent tectonics, after  the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. The  best  age  estimate  for  region-wide  world-class  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the 
Ashanti  belt,  however,  is  constrained  to  2105  ±  2  Ma  (Oberthür  et  al.,  1998). By 
comparison, regional orogenic gold mineralisation is younger in the KKI and is better 
correlated with the 2063 ± 9 Ma minor gold phase reported in the Damang area (Pigois 
et al., 2003) or the 2074 ± 14 Ma gold phase at Morila in southern Mali (McFarlane et 
al., 2011). Regional peak metamorphism was dated at ca. 2100 Ma in the Ashanti belt of 
southern Ghana (Oberthür et al., 1998) whereas metamorphic monazite and titanite from 
west  to  central  Ivory  Coast  record  regional  metamorphism  at  2080  ±  10  Ma 
(Kouamelan, 1996). || These data will be used 
to discuss the tectono-magmatic evolution of the KKI and geodynamic implications. 3. Geological setting of the Kédougou-Kénieba inlier 
  The  Kédougou-Kénieba  inlier  (KKI)  is  the  westernmost  exposed  part  of  the 
Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain in the West African Craton (inset Fig. 1). The 
inlier  is  bounded  on  its  western  margin  by  the  Hercynian  Mauritanides  (Villeneuve, 
2008). It is unconformably overlain by Neoproterozoic cover (i.e. || Timing of regional orogenic gold mineralisation  
The relative timing of gold mineralisation is well constrained with respect to the 
structural  evolution  of  the  KKI. No  absolute  ages  for  the  region-wide  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation,  however,  have  yet  been  reported. Such  data  would  allow  regional 
correlations  to  be  made,  which  in  turn  could  provide  critical  information  in  terms  of 
geological  development  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  2028  ±  10  Ma  age  for  gold 
mineralisation at Gara in the Loulo district reported by Vielreicher (U-Pb on xenotime 
and monazite, 2006) is incompatible with the proposed tectonic evolution of the KKI. Such  young  age  may  relate  to  cooling  paths  after  the  late  Eburnean  tectono-thermal 
event. 234 || mineralization in the El Callao district, Venezuela: Economic Geology, v. 109, p. 457-

A total of 277 polished thin sections were prepared at the University of Western 
Australia  (UWA)  and  at  Vancouver  Petrographics  Ltd. The  database  included  62 
polished  thin  sections  from  regional  outcrops,  60  from  Sadiola  Hill,  58  from 
Alamoutala,  41  from  Yatela,  10  from  FE3-FE4,  and  14  from  KW18. Transmitted  and 
reflected light optical microscopy was used to investigate rock types, alteration textures 
and intensities, ore mineralogy, and strain fabrics in magmatic and sedimentary rocks of 
the region. Such study took place at the Centre for Exploration Targeting (UWA) and 
enabled prioritisation of samples for higher resolution microscopy. || 4. Alamoutala exploration and mining history 
The Alamoutala gold deposit is located in the Yatela mining district. The district 
displays  widespread  evidence  of  ancient  and  recent  artisanal  mining,  with  written 
records  of  mining  dating  back  more  than  250  years  (public  data  from  IAMGold 
website). A geochemical survey was conducted in 1994 over the Alamoutala and Yatela 
prospects, followed by trench sampling in 1996. Drill testing resulted in the discovery 
of  a  significant  gold  resource  at  Yatela  and  a  minor  one  at  Alamoutala. Disseminated 
magnetite  is  abundant  in  host  rocks  at  Alamoutala  but  has  never  been  of  economic 
interest  in  contrast  to  the  magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  district  (see  Fig. || 4.7. Primary ore mineralogy 
The primary mineralisation is pyrite-rich, contains abundant chalcopyrite, minor 
arsenopyrite,  and  accessory  Zn-Pb-Sb-Ag-Co-Ni-Fe-bearing  mineral  species. Pyrite  is 
the  dominant  sulphide  phase  at  Yatela  and  largely  occurs  in  two  forms  that  include 
single euhedral to subhedral crystals and crystal aggregates (Fig. 9A). Chalcopyrite and 
arsenopyrite  are  also  common  ore  phases. Chalcopyrite  occurs  as  subhedral  crystals 
enclosed in pyrite, crystals intergrown with pyrite, interstitial space infill between pyrite 
crystals,  infill  of  micro-fractures  in  pyrite,  crystals  mantling  pyrite  faces,  and  as 
overgrowths  on  pyrite  (Fig. || 4.8. Karst infill stratigraphy 
Post-Birimian  karstification  and  the  development  of  a  deep  weathering  profile 
have  modified  the  original  lithostratigraphy  in  the  Yatela  deposit  area. The  dominant 
geological  feature  at  Yatela  is  the  presence  of  a  complex  surficial  karst  topography 
characterised by coalescing troughs that are infilled by unconsolidated sandy material. The  vertically-extensive  trough  in  the  southern  part  of  the  open  pit  is  220  m  deep. Drilling  and  satellite  pits  targeting  oxide  ore  have  allowed  this  buried  karstic 
topography  to  be  traced  northwards  up  to  the  Neoproterozoic  sandstone  escarpment 
where it thins out. The karst infill shows a simple stratigraphy as follows (Fig. || 5.2. Structural framework 
The  Sadiola  Hill,  Yatela,  and  ancillary  pits  share  a  similar  tectonic  evolution 
(Fig. 2, 3). The data presented hereafter integrates extensive data collected in the open 
pits with data collected from surface outcrop mapping. The earliest structural component (D1s) recorded in the region consists of NNW- to N-
trending  folds. These  folds  are  associated  with  a  weak  to  strong  axial-planar  cleavage 
(S1)  and  a  gently  NNW-plunging  intersection  lineation  (L1)  (Fig. || D3y documented at Yatela relate to the evolution of a regional system accommodating 
oblique convergence during the Eburnean orogeny (ca. 2115-2060 Ma). The steep ENE-
trending  sub-vertical  faults  recorded  at  Yatela  crosscut  the  ore-hosting  structures  and 
hence  post-date  the  primary  mineralisation. Fault  geometry  and  associated  dextral 
kinematic indicators are consistent with E-W oriented shortening (D4y). At the regional 
scale, this D4y deformation phase could correlate with the very late Eburnean (ca. 2060-
2050 Ma) dextral reactivation described by Dabo and Aïfa (2011) in the Falémé region. || Figure  13. Series  of  schematic  geological  cross-sections  illustrating  a  protracted  ore-forming

in the orebodies were evaluated using three-dimensional rendering of grade control and

regional  mapping  transects  were  undertaken  using  of  a  rugged  tablet  containing 
geophysical data such as magnetics and radiometrics under ArcGIS. Two transects were 
undertaken  across  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  from  East  to  West  and  two  transects

the Yatela karst infill succession was capped by barren alluvial cover (Fig. 13D). The  presence  of  carbonate  host  rocks,  characteristics  of  the  primary  mineralisation, 
semi-arid climatic conditions, and weathering intensity were probably the major factors 
that determined residual and supergene gold enrichment at Yatela (e.g., Anand and Butt, 
2010). The  Yatela-style  orebodies  represent  attractive  exploration  opportunities  as  the 
surficial  karst  cavities  are  deep  and  laterally  extensive. The  Yatela-style  targets, 
however, represent an exploration challenge. || Representative electron probe micro-analyses 
of hydrothermal tourmalines are presented in Appendix A. Micro-analyses indicate that 
the tourmalines at Yatela belong to the alkali group and the schorl-dravite series, similar 
to those identified at the Sadiola Hill gold deposit and in the Loulo district (Fig. 8A-B). Syn-mineralisation  stage  tourmalines  at  Yatela  also  plot  along  the  oxydravite-
povondraite  compositional  trend  (meta-evaporite  tie  line  proposed  by  Henry  et  al., 
2008) (Fig. 8B). 146 || The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurred  during  D3y  based  on  field  relationships  and 
micro-textural observations. The equivalent structural setting and relative timing of gold 
between Yatela and other world-class gold deposits in the KKI (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence 
et  al.,  2013a;  Massawa,  Treloar  et  al.,  2014;  Sadiola  Hill,  Masurel  et  al.,  in  press) 
suggests that region-wide gold mineralisation occurred  during a  period  of  transcurrent 
tectonics, after the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. Although not 
diagnostic  of  a  specific  fluid  source,  the  chemical  composition  of  syn-mineralisation 
hydrothermal tourmalines at Yatela is also consistent with that reported for Sadiola Hill 
(Masurel et al., in press) and for the Loulo-Bambadji  district (Lawrence  et al., 2013a; 
Lambert-Smith,  2014). At  the  district  scale,  the  primary  ore  paragenesis  at  Yatela  is 
compatible with the Au-As-Sb ± Cu-Ag-W-Mo-Bi-Zn-Pb-Te metal signature identified 
at  Sadiola  Hill  (Masurel  et  al.,  in  press). The  presence  of  pyrite  as  principal  sulphide 
phase  at  Yatela,  however,  is  interpreted  to  reflect  a  host-rock  dependency,  and/or  a 
spatial  zoning  of  metals  with  increasing  distance  from  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone, 
157 || The development of NNE-trending upright folds 
(F2)  and  penetrative  axial-planar  cleavage  (S2)  is  cryptic  at  Yatela  but  represents  the 
dominant structural feature 1.5 km west in the KW18 ancillary pits and 25 km south at 
the world-class Sadiola Hill gold deposit. Fold geometry and lineation data associated 
with  the  second  deformation  event  (D2y)  are  consistent  with  NW-SE  directed 
shortening. The  D2y  event  is  compatible  with  a  period  of  fold-and-thrust  tectonics 
responsible  for  the  region-wide  structural  grain  (D2)  (in  Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,

associated  with  irregular  (e.g.,  dendritic  to  wire-like  forms),  angular  secondary  gold 
grains (Hein et al., in press). Such morphology is interpreted to result from mobilisation 
(physical  and/or  chemical)  of  the  locally-sourced  primary  (hypogene)  gold  during  the 
creation  of  a  deep  weathering  profile  and  associated  karstification  processes  (e.g.,

upper-Cretaceous  across  West  Africa  (e.g.,  Brown  et  al.,  1994;  Lavaud  et  al.,  2004). The surficial dissolution of the carbonate host rocks resulted in the creation of troughs 
that  were  draped  and  filled  with  a  ferruginous  dissolution  residue  locally  containing 
secondary gold (e.g., Hein et al., in press) and blocks of Neoproterozoic sandstone that 
are  likely  to  have  collapsed  into  the  Yatela  depocentre  because  karstification  started

The  Yatela  gold  deposit  is  located  in  the  Kédougou-Kénieba  inlier  (KKI),  a

deposits in the district is comparable to that of other world-class orogenic gold deposits 
in the KKI. Despite the commonalities, gold mineralisation in the Sadiola-Yatela district 
exhibits  three  distinct  styles  defined  on  the  basis  of  contrasted  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis. The  three gold mineralisation styles  are typified by  the Sadiola Hill-style 
Au-As-Sb  mineralisation,  the  Alamoutala-style  Au-Cu  mineralisation,  and  the  Yatela-
style  auriferous  residuum. The  metal  enrichment  association  and  geothermometric 
estimates from ore and alteration paragenesis at Sadiola Hill are compatible with those 
of mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-
300°C)  orogenic  gold  deposits  worldwide. The  Alamoutala  deposit  represents  two 
distinct  hydrothermal  systems  in  which  a  magnetite-bearing  skarn  developed  locally

history of the auriferous residuum through mineralogical, textural and geochronological 
investigations,  and  suggested  that:  1)  the  auriferous  residuum  consists  of  a  mixture  of 
underlying  insoluble  bedrock  fragments  (e.g.,  metagreywacke,  marble,  metadiorite), 
blocks  and  pebbles  of  Neoproterozoic  sandstone,  and  quartz  fragments  and  pebbles, 
which  are  set  into  a  brown-red  sandy  matrix;  2)  the  maximum  deposition  age  for  the 
auriferous residuum is constrained in the Neoproterozoic, or during early deposition of 
the Taoudeni sandstone; 3) the formation of the residuum likely involved a local source 
that included recycled material based on gold grain morphology and detrital zircon ages; 
and  4)  the  creation  of  a  deep  weathering  profile  and  supergene  enrichment  of  the 
auriferous residuum may have taken place during the mid-Cretaceous to early Tertiary. In this study, we summarise the geology, tectonic setting, hydrothermal alteration, and 
ore  mineralogy  of  the  primary  gold  mineralisation  at  Yatela  with  the  objective  of 
defining  its  link  to  the  auriferous  residuum,  and  thus  form  the  basis  of  an  ore  genetic 
model for the deposit. 3. Background

d’Ivoire. 2. Introduction 
The KKI is the westernmost exposure (~22000 km2) of Paleoproterozoic crust in 
the  West  African  Craton. It  hosts  a  number  of  world-class  mining  districts,  which 
include Loulo-Gounkoto (~14 Moz), Sadiola-Yatela (~10 Moz) and Sabodala-Massawa 
(~8  Moz). Gold  deposits  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  host  rocks  that  include  mafic 
volcanics,  detrital  sedimentary  rocks  and  carbonates,  and  share  a  similar  structural 
setting  and  relative  timing  to  other  world-class  orogenic  gold  systems  in  the  West 
African Craton (e.g., Ashanti, Morila) (Oberthür et al., 1998; Allibone et al., 2002a, b; 
Feybesse et al., 2006; McFarlane et al., 2011; Lawrence et al., 2013a, b; Treloar et al., 
2014; Masurel et al., in press). || U-Pb  geochronology  work  (zircon  mount 
making, imaging and SHRIMP data collection) was undertaken by the candidate under 
the supervision of Nicolas Thébaud. John Miller provided re-processed geophysical data 
used  as  a  base  for  the  making  of  district-scale  geological  map. John  Miller  also 
contributed to the interpretation of the structural evolution of the Sadiola-Yatela district. Stanislav  Ulrich  provided  a  comprehensive  appraisal  of  the  study  and  constructive 
scientific reviews. Electronic  Appendix  A:  the  manuscript  entitled  “The  Yatela  gold  deposit:  2  billion

facies deposition from carbonate sequences to flysch-type detrital sedimentary rocks in

Although  gold  deposits  of  the  district  share  equivalent  structural  setting  and 
relative gold timing, the diversity in ore paragenesis, nature and chemistry of wall-rock 
alteration recognised over the camp points toward three distinct styles of mineralisation 
typified by the Sadiola Hill, the Alamoutala, and the Yatela gold deposits (Table 1). The 
typical  gold-related  hydrothermal  alteration  assemblage  in  the  district  is  defined  as

The Yatela gold mine is located 25 km north of the world-class Sadiola Hill gold 
mine  in  southwest  Mali  (Fig. 2). Economic  mineralisation  at  Yatela  occurs  in  a 
saprolitic  residuum  that  lines  the  bottom  of  deep  troughs  (max. depth  of  220  m) 
developed  over  carbonate  rocks  (Hein  et  al.,  in  press). The  residuum  consists  of  a 
mixture  of  underlying 
insoluble  Paleoproterozoic  bedrock 
fragments 
(e.g., 
metagreywacke, marble, metadiorite), blocks and pebbles of Neoproterozoic sandstone, 
quartz  fragments  and  pebbles,  and  gossanous  fragments  derived  from  the  primary 
hypogene mineralisation, which are set into a clay-rich ferruginous matrix (Hanssen et 
al., 2004).",Yatela gold mine,llm
2015_Masurel_phd.txt,109,"4. Alamoutala exploration and mining history 
The Alamoutala gold deposit is located in the Yatela mining district. The district 
displays  widespread  evidence  of  ancient  and  recent  artisanal  mining,  with  written 
records  of  mining  dating  back  more  than  250  years  (public  data  from  IAMGold 
website). A geochemical survey was conducted in 1994 over the Alamoutala and Yatela 
prospects, followed by trench sampling in 1996. Drill testing resulted in the discovery 
of  a  significant  gold  resource  at  Yatela  and  a  minor  one  at  Alamoutala. Disseminated 
magnetite  is  abundant  in  host  rocks  at  Alamoutala  but  has  never  been  of  economic 
interest  in  contrast  to  the  magnetite  skarns  of  the  Falémé  district  (see  Fig.",Yatela mining district,llm

4.1. Pit mapping, drill core logging, sampling and 3D modelling  
Systematic face mapping was conducted on all accessible ramps and benches of 
the  Yatela  open  pit  where  fresh  rocks  are  exposed. As  of  2013,  the  main  open  pit  is 
1,300 m in length, 600 m wide and 220 m deep. Detailed logging was undertaken and 
included  five  diamond  drill  holes  chosen  to  represent  the  main  structural,  lithological 
and mineralogical variations observed in the deposit. Petrographic data reported in this 
paper investigates primary mineralisation and therefore largely relies on deep diamond 
drill  core  samples. || 4.9. Secondary gold distribution  
There  is  a  spatial  relationship  between  the  NNW-trending  faults  in  carbonate 
near  the  Yatela  diorite,  the  location  of  hydrothermal  alteration  and  primary 
mineralisation,  and  the  location  of  auriferous  residuum  (Fig. 12A). In  contrast,  the 
ENE-trending  and  WNW-trending  sub-vertical  fault  sets  do  not  appear  as  dominant 
controls on development of the auriferous residuum. The steep WNW-trending normal 
faults, however, bound the main karst cavity in the Yatela open pit and may have played 
a  significant  role  in  the  deposition  of  the  blocky  sand  and  fine  sand  units  (Fig. 12B). || All  structural  readings  are  given  in  true  north  coordinates. Planar

The  geology  of  the  Kofi  basin  in  the  Yatela  region  consists  of  feldspathic  wackes, 
arkosic  arenites,  and  carbonates,  with  subordinate  rhyolite  flows,  and  pyroclastites  to 
the  west  progressing  to  siltstones  and  argillites  further  east  (Fig. 2). Thick  sequences 
(>250 m) of carbonate rocks are exposed and consist of limestones locally interlayered 
with dolomitic horizons. The original lithostratigraphy consisted of carbonates overlain 
by younger sequences of detrital sedimentary rocks based on way-up indicators, such as 
fining-upwards  sequences,  scour-and-fill  structures,  and  rare  cross-bedding 
in 
sandstone. Chemical and detrital sedimentary rocks of the Kofi basin transition towards 
the  west  into  a  linear  volcano-sedimentary  belt  that  consists  of  calc-alkaline 
volcaniclastic  rocks  and  porphyritic  andesite  flows. || The  geology  of  the  KKI  differs  from  other  Paleoproterozoic  granite-greenstone 
belts and sedimentary basins by the abundance of carbonate rocks. The Yatela deposit 
occurs within 8 km of the regional-scale Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. Country rocks in the 
Yatela region have been subjected to polycyclic deformation and regional greenschist-
facies metamorphism. A syn-kinematic diorite stock has intruded the metasedimentary 
sequences in the open pit and is associated with a hornblende-hornfels contact aureole. Field relationships and micro-textural data indicate that the primary gold mineralisation 
is  shear-hosted. The  similar  relative  timing  and  structural  setting  between  the  Yatela 
primary  gold  mineralisation  and  other  world-class  deposits  in  the  region  (e.g.,  Loulo,

The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold 
production 
in 
the  world. The  Kédougou-Kénieba 
inlier  (KKI)  represents 
the 
westernmost  exposure  of  Paleoproterozoic  crust  in  the  West  African  Craton,  with 
outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent 
discoveries  in  the  inlier  have  triggered  a  real  need  for  understanding  the  controls  on 
gold  mineral  system  location  and  ore  shoot  geometry  in  order  to  improve  Brownfield 
and  Greenfield  exploration  strategies. Through  a  multiscale  and  multidisciplinary 
approach  including  structural  geology,  petrography,  geochemistry  and  geochronology, 
this  work  presents  the  first  integrated  study  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  world-class

interpreted  to  represent  syn-deformational  foreland  basins  (e.g.,  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002; Gueye et al., 2008). Four deformation episodes have been identified in the KKI 
and include early thrusting events associated with crustal thickening (D1-D2), followed 
by  two  transcurrent  events  (D3-D4)  accomodating  oblique  convergence  (Ledru  et  al., 
1991;  Milési  et  al.,  1992;  Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010,  2011;  Diene  et  al.,  2012). Little  is 
known  about  the  earliest  event  (D1)  due  to  pervasive  reworking  by  subsquent 
deformation. The D2 and D3 events mark the principal imprint of the Eburnean orogeny 
(ca. 2115-2050 Ma) in the eastern part of the KKI and are undoubtedly responsible for 
the formation of map-scale structures (Lawrence et al., 2013a; Masurel et al., in press). || 2090 and 2070 Ma, after 
the cessation of regional compressional deformation (Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et

district, which collectively represent the largest Birimian iron resource of West Africa 
(750  Mt  ore  reserves,  ArcellorMittal  2007,  press  release)  (Fig. 1). The  iron  skarns 
formed  post-peak  metamorphism  at  ca. 2080  Ma  and  are  spatially  and  genetically 
associated  with  syn-kinematic  plutons,  such  as  the  Balangouma  monzodiorite  and  the 
Boboti  clinopyroxene-hornblende-bearing  granodiorite  (Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002; 
Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a;  Lambert-Smith,  2014). Recent 
research in the eastern part of the KKI has highlighted the spatial association between 
calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron skarn mineralization, 
suggesting  the  potential  role  of  a  complex  fluid  history  in  the  development  of  major 
gold deposits (e.g., Loulo, Lawrence et al., 2013a,b). || 8. Conclusions 
Recent  research  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  KKI  has  highlighted  the  spatial 
association between calc-alkaline Eburnean plutons, gold mineralization, and local iron 
skarn  mineralization,  suggesting  a  complex  fluid  evolution  in  relation  to  the 
development of major gold deposits (e.g., Lawrence et al., 2013a, b). The emplacement 
of Eburnean quartz-feldspar-porphyry stocks in the Alamoutala deposit area resulted in 
the  formation  of  a  low  P-high  T  magnetite-bearing  skarn  in  a  geological  setting 
analogous  to  that  of  the  Falémé  iron  skarns  (e.g.,  Schwartz  and  Melcher,  2004). The 
gold  mineralization  is  shear-hosted  and  occured  subsequently  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent 
tectonics,  and 
thus  overprints 
the  contact-metamorphic  mineral 
assemblages. The current study indicates that the magmatic episode occurred at 2083 ± 
7 Ma, and thus regional orogenic gold mineralization is younger than this age. 119 || D)  Weighted  average  plot  of  all  near-concordant  analyses

The  Alamoutala  quartz-feldspar-porphyry  is  locally  bordered  by  contact 
metamorphic  zones 
in  country  rocks. Amphibolite-facies  contact-metamorphic 
assemblages  overprint  regional  greenschist  facies  metamorphism  of  host  rocks  on  the 
basis  of  textural  relationships,  which  indicates  that  the  peak  of  the  regional 
metamorphism  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  KKI  occurred  prior  to  2083  ±  7  Ma. Early 
recrystallization of limestone was followed by the development of both exoskarns and 
endoskarns,  which  resulted  in  the  destruction  of  all  primary  tectono-metamorphic 
texture  in  the  host  rocks  (Fig. 6A).",eastern part of the KKI,llm

Ga. The geology of the KKI consists of linear greenstone belts and wider sedimentary 
basins. Available geochronological data indicate that distinct peaks of magmatic activity 
occurred in the region from ca. 2200 Ma to 2070 Ma (e.g., Boher et al., 1992; Dia et al., 
1997; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye et al., 2007,

southern parts of the KKI but limited data exist for the eastern part of the inlier, which 
hosts  the  world-class  Loulo  and  Sadiola-Yatela  gold  districts. Hence,  the  study  of 
igneous  rocks  in  that  exceptionally  gold-endowed  region  appears  critical  not  only  to 
unravel  the  tectono-thermal  evolution  of  the  KKI  crust  but  also  in  terms  of  mineral

and Aïfa, 2010, 2011; McFarlane et al., 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Gueye et al., 2008). At 
the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et 
al., 2009; in Burkina Faso, Hein, 2010; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in

as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala 
quartz-feldspar-porphyry  stocks  emplaced  in  the  upper  crust  syn-D2y  but  were  sheared 
subsequently  during  D3y. The  economic  gold  mineralization  at  Alamoutala  formed 
during  D3y  coeval  with  sinistral  displacement  along  the  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone  and 
Alamoutala Fracture Zone. The similar relative timing and structural setting between the 
Alamoutala  gold  deposit  and  other  deposits  of  the  KKI  (e.g.,  Loulo,  Lawrence  et  al., 
2013a; Massawa, Treloar et al., 2014; Sadiola Hill, Masurel et al., in press) suggest that 
gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that 
outlasted  emplacement  of  the  Falémé-type  granitoids,  after  the  cessation  of  regional 
compressional deformation. || The polycyclic 
deformation  history  recorded  in  the  KKI  is  similar  to  that  reported  at  the  scale  of  the 
West African Craton (In Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et al., 2009; in Burkina 
Faso, Hein, 2010; Baratoux et al., 2011; in northern Guinea, Lahondère et al., 2002; in

et al., 2011; in southern Ghana, Allibone et al., 2002a, b). As for the KKI, the bulk of 
gold  mineralisation  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana  occurred  during  a  period  of 
transcurrent tectonics, after  the cessation of regional-scale compressional deformation. The  best  age  estimate  for  region-wide  world-class  orogenic  gold  mineralisation  in  the 
Ashanti  belt,  however,  is  constrained  to  2105  ±  2  Ma  (Oberthür  et  al.,  1998). By 
comparison, regional orogenic gold mineralisation is younger in the KKI and is better 
correlated with the 2063 ± 9 Ma minor gold phase reported in the Damang area (Pigois 
et al., 2003) or the 2074 ± 14 Ma gold phase at Morila in southern Mali (McFarlane et 
al., 2011). Regional peak metamorphism was dated at ca. 2100 Ma in the Ashanti belt of 
southern Ghana (Oberthür et al., 1998) whereas metamorphic monazite and titanite from

leucogranite that intruded the Kofi sediments has been dated at 2045 ± 27 Ma (Bassot 
and Caen-Vachette, 1984; Rb-Sr on whole rock). Birimian rocks of the KKI have undergone polycyclic deformation. Early phases 
of fold-and-thrust tectonics (D1-D2) linked to initial accretion are followed by a period 
of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa,

for  hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  Sadiola  camp. The  sinistral  reactivation  of  early 
accretionary  structures,  and  their  linkage  with  belt-discordant  NNE-trending  shears, 
appears to be a critical factor controlling ore deposit location and ore shoot geometry. Paragenetic  studies  reveal  a  multistage  ore  development  comprising  an  early  As-rich 
sulfide  stage,  followed  by  an  Au-Sb  stage. The  similar  gold  relative  timing  and 
structural  setting  in  the  KKI  and  southern  Ghana  (e.g.,  Ashanti,  Loulo,  Massawa,

the regional scale D2y is compatible with a period of fold-and-thrust tectonics correlated 
with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et

as  a  transpressional  fault  during  D2  deformation,  coeval  with  development  of  the  S2 
penetrative  cleavage  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). The  Alamoutala

gold mineralization in the region occurred during a period of transcurrent tectonics that

compressional deformation. || 7. Discussion 
7.1. Integration  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  with  regional  geology 
and tectonics  
In  this  section,  the  local  deformation  history  identified  at  Sadiola  Hill  is 
compared to the prolonged tectono-magmatic history recorded in other Paleoproterozoic 
greenstone  belts  of  the  West  African  Craton. At  least  two  phases  of  folding  have 
affected  the  country  rocks  in  the  Sadiola  Hill  deposit  area. Little  is  known  about  the 
kinematics  of  the  earliest  local  deformation  phase  (D1s),  but  fold  geometry  and 
associated  lineation  data  are  consistent  with  NE-SW-directed  shortening. At  the 
regional  scale,  D1s  is  compatible  with  an  early  deformation  event  (D1)  recorded  in 
southern Mali (Liégeois et al., 1991; McFarlane et al., 2011). || Detrital zircons in the Loulo area have been dated between 2156 ± 10 Ma 
and  2125  ±  8  Ma  (Calvez  et  al.,  1990;  Pb-Pb  zircon). The  peraluminous  Gamaye 
leucogranite that intruded the Kofi sediments has been dated at 2045 ± 27 Ma (Bassot 
and Caen-Vachette, 1984; Rb-Sr on whole rock). Birimian rocks of the KKI have undergone polycyclic deformation. Early phases 
of fold-and-thrust tectonics (D1-D2) linked to initial accretion are followed by a period 
of transcurrent tectonics (D3-D4) (Ledru et al., 1991; Milési et al., 1992; Dabo and Aïfa, 
2010, 2011; Diene et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2013a; Treloar et al., 2014). A similar 
polyphase character has been reported in other Birimian terranes of West Africa (e.g., in 
Ivory  Coast,  Pouclet  et  al.,  2006;  Vidal  et  al.,  2009;  in  Burkina  Faso,  Hein,  2010;  in 
Guinea,  Lahondère  et  al.,  2002;  in  southern  Mali,  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011;  in  southern 
Ghana, Feybesse et al., 2006; in Burkina Faso, Baratoux et al., 2011). The SMSZ and 
MTZ have been interpreted to represent major transpressional faults initiated during D2 
(Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a). || For comparison, the orogenic overprint at the 
Morila gold deposit in southern Mali is constrained to have occurred at 2074 ± 14 Ma 
(hydrothermal  titanite,  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011). In  addition  to  primary  orogenic  gold 
mineralisation, prospectivity in the region is increased due to the exploration potential 
for  Yatela-style  orebodies. Such  orebodies  formed  by  residual  and  supergene  gold 
enrichment processes associated with the development of a deep weathering profile over 
carbonate host rocks. 1.6. Hydrothermal alteration 
Although  gold  deposits  of  the  district  share  equivalent  structural  setting  and 
relative gold timing, the diversity in ore paragenesis, nature and chemistry of wall-rock 
alteration recognised over the camp points toward three distinct styles of mineralisation 
typified by the Sadiola Hill, the Alamoutala, and the Yatela gold deposits (Table 1). The 
typical  gold-related  hydrothermal  alteration  assemblage  in  the  district  is  defined  as 
biotite  +  calcite-dolomite  +  quartz  ±  actinolite-tremolite  ±  muscovite  ±  tourmaline  ± 
pyrite-arsenopyrite-pyrrhotite. || Liégeois, J.P., Claessens, W., Camara, D., and Klerkx, J., 1991, Short-lived Eburnian orogeny

the

province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent

Ga. The geology of the KKI consists of linear greenstone belts and wider sedimentary 
basins. Available geochronological data indicate that distinct peaks of magmatic activity 
occurred in the region from ca. 2200 Ma to 2070 Ma (e.g., Boher et al., 1992; Dia et al., 
1997; Hirdes and Davis, 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006; Dioh et al., 2006; Gueye et al., 2007, 
2008). Intensive  studies  of  the  Eburnean  granitoids  have  focused  on  the  western  and 
southern parts of the KKI but limited data exist for the eastern part of the inlier, which 
hosts  the  world-class  Loulo  and  Sadiola-Yatela  gold  districts. Hence,  the  study  of 
igneous  rocks  in  that  exceptionally  gold-endowed  region  appears  critical  not  only  to 
unravel  the  tectono-thermal  evolution  of  the  KKI  crust  but  also  in  terms  of  mineral 
system,  whereby  gold  deposits  are  viewed  as  local  expressions  of  orogen-  to
