utility  in  lithologic  discrimination,  outcrop  delineation  and  production  of  geological  maps  at  different 
scales (Qari et al 2008). This study focused on the identification of various lithological units using Landsat images with the aim of 
using  them  as  part  of  a  dataset for  mineral  (gold and  other  mineral commodities)  potential targeting  in 
Burkina  Faso,  mapping  of  geological  structures  and  also  land  use/cover  data  sets. This  was  completed 
using  six  Landsat  images,  radiometric  and  magnetic  data. The  images  will  be  georeferenced  using 
geographic  coordination  systems  or  projections. Based  on  the  spectral  capabilities  of  Landsat  7  image 
data, the RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) band combination was prepared for discrimination of geological 
features  (lithology,  structure  and  contacts). Although  the  spectral  capabilities  of  Landsat  data  do  not 
provide new information on lithology, they are useful for extracting geological features that might have 
not been defined by field studies and aerial photography or maps in the area. || CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Preamble 
Most geological maps of Burkina Faso are outdated and due to high cost of aerial photography the maps 
have not been updated. There is massive investment in exploration in NE Burkina Faso and there are few 
geological maps that assist in targeting, with the latest being completed by Castaing in 2003. Therefore a 
GIS  interpretation  was  undertaken  to  create  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  for  the  area. GIS 
interpretation has become the most important modern tool for geological interpretation and a fundamental 
approach in grassroots exploration for the delineation of resource potential. It involves the breaking up of 
complex  data  planes  into  simpler  and  more  interpretable  forms  related  to  geological  features. Remote 
sensing analysis from GIS is used to extract drainage and topographic patterns, curvilinear features and 
stands of lithologically related vegetation (Drury, 1987). || Figure  4.3: The  Boromo–Goren  Greenstone  Belt  (BGGB)  of  Burkina  Faso,  together  with the  Bouroum

Satellite  images  are  among  continuous  sources  of  digital  data  for  mapping  geological  structures,

Burkina Faso was created using Landsat 7 imagery combined with radiometric and magnetic data. Four 
different  false  color  composite  images  of  Landsat  data  (FCC  731,742,753  and  432)  RGB  images  were 
generated and evaluated for lithological mapping and human geography studies. A false color composite 
image of Landsat data 731 (RGB) was generated and used for production of the strato-tectonic-magmatic 
map for the study area. Analysis of geological structures such as lineaments, shear zone, dykes, plutons 
and lithological discrimination as well as geographic features was carried out using IDRISI Kilimanjaro 
software and CorelDraw X3 ® software packages. Throughout  this  study  Landsat  data  731(RGB)  was  used  for  extraction  process. || CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Preamble 
Most geological maps of Burkina Faso are outdated and due to high cost of aerial photography the maps 
have not been updated. There is massive investment in exploration in NE Burkina Faso and there are few 
geological maps that assist in targeting, with the latest being completed by Castaing in 2003. Therefore a 
GIS  interpretation  was  undertaken  to  create  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  for  the  area. GIS 
interpretation has become the most important modern tool for geological interpretation and a fundamental 
approach in grassroots exploration for the delineation of resource potential. It involves the breaking up of 
complex  data  planes  into  simpler  and  more  interpretable  forms  related  to  geological  features. Remote 
sensing analysis from GIS is used to extract drainage and topographic patterns, curvilinear features and 
stands of lithologically related vegetation (Drury, 1987). || Figure  3.2:  Aeromagnetic  data  A,  B,  C  with  total  magnetic  intensity  reduced  to  the  pole  1st  vertical 
derivative. D-represents overlay of the three magnetic data (A, B and C). 3.1.4 Radiometric data 
Total K-Th-U RGB data for NE Burkina Faso was used. Due to the image being cut off only few parts of 
the image making the study area will be used. There are two images making the radiometric data (figure 
4) and using CorelDraw X3 ® Software the two image in figure 4 A and C were inverted. 27 || The  Birimian  Bouroum-Yalogo  greenstone  belt  is  a  Y-shaped  terrane  located  between  large

indicate  interplay  of  marine-deltaic  sedimentary  processes  and  volcanic  activity. The  deposition  was 
interpreted to have occurred within a marginal marine setting adjacent to an emergent volcanic centre or 
island arc setting (Hein et al., 2004). The conformable nature (angular unconformity) of the successions: 
the 1) Lower Birimian and 2) Upper Birimian does not provide any case of separation into two formations

georeferenced using image to image rectification with SPOT images projected in UTM, (Zone 365) and 
referenced onto the WGS 84 ellipsoid. An average of 12 ground control points per image were used; with 
a  residual  error  of  approximately  2.1  metres. The  three  scenes  were  mosaiced  and  an  image  enclosing

An  extensive  residual  laterite  cap  exists  in  the  study  area  (Hein. 2008). Laterite  is  an  iron-rich 
profile that is developed under tropical to sub-tropical condition due to long term exposure of rocks to the 
atmosphere and hydrosphere in tectonically stable areas (Dequincey et al., 2006).The ferricrete is matrix 
to  clast  supported  and  typically  contains  clasts  and  rock  fragments  of  the  underlying  stratigraphy 
(Middleton et al., 1997) and is currently forming in lowland areas. The general outcrop distribution of 
ferricrete indicate that, the ferricrete has been eroded, deposited and cemented several times such that the 
current  ferricrete  profile  is  representative  of  several  phases  of  ferricrete  formation  (Middleton  et  al.,

2.1 Stratigraphy 
The  lithostratigraphy  in  north-eastern  Burkina  Faso  is  defined  by  NE-trending  Birimian  meta-
volcaniclastic  greywacke  and  intercalated  meta-conglomerate,  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  1. 2). The 
Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower 
Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in 
origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated 
black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et 
al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists 
of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al., 
1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian

alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are
