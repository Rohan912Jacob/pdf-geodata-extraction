1966.02 metres. Core logging was completed after the sample collection. The boreholes intersected 
the Sadiola Hill deposit, and transect from the hangingwall greywacke sequence in the west to the 
footwall carbonate sequence in the east. Thin sections were cut and prepared by SGS laboratories in Booysen in Johannesburg. The petrographic study (reflected and transmitted light) was completed at the University of the

The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which 
is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises 
meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and 
marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two 
facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite 
and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part 
of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta-

The main aim of this research project is to derive an ore genetic model that characterizes the potential 
source of gold mineralization and the style of deposition at the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, by 
petrographical investigation of the host rocks and associated sulphides. Microscopic analyses will be 
used to identify any characteristic indicator minerals which characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, 
alteration and sulphide assemblages. A detailed study of mineralogy, alteration assemblage and 
microstructures will be of importance in contrasting the intrusion-related style with the shear-hosted 
style hypotheses with which the difference will be used to establish the most likely model for the 
Sadiola Hill deposit. 1.4 Abbreviations and acronyms

2.1.1 Geology of the West African Craton 
The West African Craton (WAC) is composed of an Achaean and Palaeoproterozoic basement that is 
divided into two shields which are the Reguibat shield in the north and the Man shield in south (Potrel 
et al., 1998). These two shields are separated by the Taoudeni basin, which is Neoproterozoic to 
Devonian in age and are entirely surrounded by Pan African and Hercynian belts (Matthias et al. 2002). The Reguibat shield contains Palaeoproterozoic assemblages in the eastern part as well as 
Archean relicts which include kimberlites (Ennih and Liegeois, 2008). Large parts of the WAC in the 
Man Shield consist of Palaeoproterozoic rocks referred to as the Birimian Supergroup (Abouchami et 
al. 1990; Beziat et al., 2000).",Reguibat shield,llm

with biotite-chlorite alteration in vein margins and in the wall rock matrix. The distribution of gold 
and sulphides in alteration zones indicates that they are of hydrothermal epigenetic origin. The biotite

with hornblende-hornfels facies contact metamorphism of the meta-sedimentary rocks and gold 
mineralization throughout the Sadiola goldfield (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a). From the

A number of different ore genesis models have been proposed for Sadiola Hill deposit. These include 
epithermal, Carlin-type, Skarn, thermal aureole and mesothermal models. This wide variety of models 
is a consequence of the relative absence of fresh sulphide mineralization for study, and most genetic 
models were based on observations of oxidized lithologies only (Boshoff et al. 1998). || 2.2 Mine geology

slump folds are crosscut by tonalite dykes, which indicates that folding occurred at an earlier stage. Original minerals in the host rocks have been slightly and/or completely changed to new minerals. This is observed in alteration zones were plagioclase has been replaced by carbonate (dolomite ± 
calcite) and locally by albite, while biotite is slightly replaced by chlorite, rutile and vermiculite. Mineral replacement reactions take place primarily by dissolution-reprecipitation processes. This 
includes: cation exchange, chemical weathering, deuteric alteration, leaching, pseudormorphism, 
metasomatism and metamorphism (Putnis, 2002). The occurrence of biotite in vein-wallrock contacts 
in the Sadiola Hill deposit is indicative of either metasomatism and/or metamorphism reactions. || A number of thin sections were studied 
in detail with the main focus on the mineral assemblages, mineral textures, cross-cutting relationships,

a paragenesis sequence for the deposit. Indicator minerals were used to characterise the type of 
deposit, enabling comparison and validation of ore genetic models for the deposit. Other boreholes from the Sadiola Hill deposit were used to design a 3D model of the deposit using 
Gemcom Surpac 6.5.1 software from the Mining Engineering computer lab. The petrographic study was preceded by literature review using the Sadiola mine reports by SEMOS 
together with other published and unpublished articles to gain an understanding of the regional and 
local geology of the study area. The table presented below show the orientation of the boreholes which were used in this study which 
are also indicated in Figure 3. || Abstract 
The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which 
is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises 
meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and 
marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two 
facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite 
and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part 
of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta-
sedimentary rocks. || As described in Chapter, shear-zone related deposit develop syntectonically in horizontal 
compressions and the host rocks are generally regionally metamorphosed under low-to-mid 
greenschist facies conditions, and also the deposit is situated within and/or around a shear zone. Sulphide mineralisation is associated with shear fabrics. The mineral and sulphide textures observed 
in this study suggest that this is not the case for the Sadiola Hill deposit as there were no visible shear 
fabrics (foliation), compressional evidence and greenschist facies. However the Sadiola deposit does 
have few features which are similar to those of shear-hosted deposits, these are: (a) carbonate 
alteration, (b) sulphides hosted in and around tectonic structures and (c) host rocks are 
metamorphosed though in the Sadiola Hill deposit it was a result of contact metamorphism rather than 
regional metamorphism which generally occurs in shear-hosted deposit. The host rocks of the Sadiola Hill deposit have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and 
epidote-chlorite facies which indicates high temperature and low pressure conditions during 
metamorphism, i.e., contact metamorphism. Contact metamorphism occurred during cooling and 
recrystallization of the tonalite-granodiorite and porphyry-quartz-feldspar dykes, and the Sekokoto 
pluton which from the alteration patterns and metamorphic facies assemblage, is suggested to be 
located on the south-eastern margin of the Sadiola main pit. || Chapter 3 Methodology 
This research project focused on detailed petrographic analyses of the Sadiola Hill deposit host rocks 
from more than 114 thin sections of diamond drill core and was preceded by literature review. The 114 selected samples of diamond drill core and other field data were collected in 2008 by Prof 
Kim Hein from 5 boreholes from the Sadiola Deep Sulphide project for a total borehole meterage of 
1966.02 metres. Core logging was completed after the sample collection. The boreholes intersected 
the Sadiola Hill deposit, and transect from the hangingwall greywacke sequence in the west to the 
footwall carbonate sequence in the east. Thin sections were cut and prepared by SGS laboratories in Booysen in Johannesburg. The petrographic study (reflected and transmitted light) was completed at the University of the 
Witwatersrand, Johannesburg using an Olympus BX14 Petrographic microscope with a dedicated 
camera in conjunction with the Stream Essentials© software. || Chapter 5: Petrography 
A number of thin sections (~114) were studied using a reflected and transmitted light microscope with 
the main focus on mineral and sulphide textures, and deformation textures. These studies helped to 
develop a paragenesis sequence of mineralisation. 5.1 Mineral textures of quartz-carbonate veins in the Sadiola Hill deposit 
The Sadiola Hill deposit has complex mineral textures in quartz-carbonate veins due to fracturing 
events, brecciation of the host rocks, alteration and crosscutting relationships. The quartz-carbonate 
sulphides are dominated by sulphides, silicate, and carbonate minerals that form an aggregate. These 
minerals and sulphides are not greatly affected by deformational events but are affected by supergene 
processes. The mineral textures of the deposit are described in four different sections which consider 
the following: 
1. || Chapter 6: Orebody modelling 
Modelling of the Sadiola Hill deposit was carried out using Gemcom Surpac software to define 
lithological contacts and to map alternation in the Sadiola Hill deposit, but did not prove to be useful. The software showed the contact relationship between the mineralised marbles and the overlying 
greywacke in boreholes in a gross way. The software was used in an attempt to show the relationship between the meta-sedimentary rocks, 
granitoid intrusions and mineralisation from boreholes in the Sadiola Hill deposit. 6.1 Software Limits 
Unfortunately, the software did not model the lithological contacts well and only recognises 
horizontal sections. As a result, all the host rocks are shown as a horizontal box, which was not ideal. Vertical granodiorite dykes were also modelled automatically as horizontal elements which was not 
logical; the software takes the upper and lower contacts of the element in each borehole and correlates 
them laterally rather than allowing in input parameters that models them as vertical. || Chapter 8: Conclusion 
An ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill deposit has been a much debated topic. A number of models 
were suggested for the deposit but only two stood out, which included the shear-hosted model by 
Hanssen et al. (1998) and the intrusion related model by Theron (1997). The two models contrast in 
terms of style of mineralisation, alteration assemblages, mineral textures and relationship between the 
host rocks and mineralisation. From the study, only a few features which characterise shear-hosted 
deposits were present but the features can also be found in intrusion related deposit. The Sadiola Hill deposit was metamorphosed by contact metamorphism during the emplacement of 
the tonalite-granodiorite and porphyry dykes, these dykes are also responsible for the fluids which 
altered the host rocks. || Gold is mainly associated with arsenopyrite, 
chalcopyrite and pyrite with an assemblage of arsen + gold + py + ccp. Sulphides in the Sadiola Hill deposit become less reduced with time and temperature due to fluids in 
contact with the carbonaceous wall rocks. The sulphide minerals are consistent with retrograde facies. Fracturing and brecciation are part of the whole vein formation process with precipitation of fresh 
sulphides after every fracturing event. Gold-sulphide mineralisation in the Sadiola Hill deposit formed during retrograde contact 
metamorphism and brittle deformation caused by the emplacement of the Sekokoto granodiorites 
(2083 ± 7Ma) at the time of the Eburmean plutonism (2150 – 2095 Ma). The Sadiola Hill deposit is 
characterised as an orogenic subclass intrusion-related deposit. || Mineralisation 
occurs in the marbles as massive and disseminated, but because the software cannot separate massive 
with disseminated sulphides, it shows that the whole pit is an orebody which is not the case in the 
Sadiola Hill deposit. Thus modelling of the orebody using the Gemcom Surpac was not useful. || Mineralisation mostly occurs in alteration zones suggesting that it was also 
related to the intrusions. From the interpretations and paragenesis, it is suggested that mineralisation in the Sadiola Hill deposit 
formed during retrograde contact metamorphism and brittle deformation caused by the emplacement 
of the tonalite-granodiorite and porphyry-quartz-feldspar dykes, and the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 
Ma) at the time of the Eburnean plutonism (~2150-2095 Ma). The SFZ was the main control of fluid 
flow during the emplacement. Mineralisation in the Sadiola Hill deposit is related to the intrusions 
therefore it is an orogenic subclass intrusion-related deposit as described by Theron (1997). || The FE3 pits are also situated within the Sadiola goldfield (Fig. 12) and contain similar host rocks to 
those of the Sadiola Hill deposit. The slump folds indicate a period of folding in the deposit and are 
interpreted to be related to the D1 tectonic phase described by Milési et al. (1989, 1992). Folding and 
thrusting events are typical for the Birimian formations (e.g. Kadio et al. || The Kofi Supergroup is obliquely cut by the N-S to NNW trending Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone,

impure carbonates to the east and its wallrock are intruded by discontinuous diorite and quartz-

sulphide in the Sadiola Hill deposit and commonly alerted to marcasite. Marcasite is a supergene 
sulphide which forms by the decomposition of pyrite and as a replacement of pyrrhotite. In some

which have been intruded by a number of felsic intrusions. The metasedimentary rocks consist of fine 
grained greywacke and impure carbonates with minor tuffs and acid volcanics (Hanssen et al., 1998). These lithologies show evidence of macroscopic to mesoscopic slump structures (Hein and 
Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). Carbonate, greywacke, quartz-feldspar-porphyry and diorite are the main 
host to the Sadiola deposit (Boshoff et al., 1998). The Sadiola Hill deposit is located along a diorite 
intruded marble-greywacke contact east of the SMFZ (Hanssen et al., 1998). || texture is consistent with that described by McFarlane et al. (2011) for the Morila gold mine in 
southeast Mali, which is classified as intrusion related gold deposit. The brecciated units are scattered around the contact aureole of the tonalite-granodiorite (Matabane, 
2008) and formed as a result of high pressure fluid circulation or by dilantacy accompanied by 
hydraulic fracturing during emplacement of the granodiorite dykes (e.g. Ethendge, 1983). The former 
correlates with skarn development described by Theron (1997a). The hydrothermal minerals in the Sadiola Hill deposit are randomly orientated (i.e. || they show no sign 
of preferred orientation); this suggest that there was no to low pressure involved at time of 
metamorphism. Low pressure metamorphism is typical to intrusion-related gold deposits (Land and 
Baker, 2001), and therefore conclusion that can be made is that contact metamorphism of host rocks 
in the Sadiola Hill deposit is associated with the adjacent tonalite-granodiorite and/or quartz-porphyry 
dykes. Tourmaline is a common accessory mineral in metamorphic rocks spanning a wide of bulk 
compositions (e.g., Henry and Dutrow, 1996), and has P-T conditions ranging from diagenesis to the 
granulite and eclogite facies (Henry et al. 1999, Marschall et al. 2009). This mineral is also common 
in the Sadiola Hill deposit.",Sadiola Hill deposit,llm

The Sadiola Hill gold mine is located within the Sadiola goldfield in the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier

goldfield is located close to the Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system and mineralisation 
has been shown to have a relationship with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and diorite dykes. The 
goldfield also hosts the FE3, FE4, Timbabougouni mines, and FE2 and Tambali prospects. The 
relative association of mineralisation with highly deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Birimian 
Supergroup makes it difficult to derive an ore genetic model. The model is important for regional and 
in-mine exploration, but also significant for understanding geologic evolution of the host rocks. A number of different ore genesis models have been proposed for Sadiola Hill deposit. || The main focus of this project has therefore been to derive an ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill 
gold deposit by contrasting the intrusion related style hypothesis proposed for the deposit by Theron

analysis. The features which will characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit (i.e. indicator minerals, 
alteration assemblage and mineral textures) will be used to contrast the two models and to establish a 
likely model for the deposit. 1.2 Location and Physiography

the regional capital, Kayes, near the international border of Mali with Senegal (Fig.1). Mali is a

The Sadiola Hill gold mine is located within the Sadiola goldfield in the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier 
(KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC) and is situated in western Mali. The Sadiola 
goldfield is located close to the Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system and mineralisation 
has been shown to have a relationship with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and diorite dykes. The 
goldfield also hosts the FE3, FE4, Timbabougouni mines, and FE2 and Tambali prospects. The 
relative association of mineralisation with highly deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Birimian 
Supergroup makes it difficult to derive an ore genetic model. The model is important for regional and 
in-mine exploration, but also significant for understanding geologic evolution of the host rocks. A number of different ore genesis models have been proposed for Sadiola Hill deposit. || The FE3 pits are also situated within the Sadiola goldfield (Fig. 12) and contain similar host rocks to 
those of the Sadiola Hill deposit. The slump folds indicate a period of folding in the deposit and are 
interpreted to be related to the D1 tectonic phase described by Milési et al. (1989, 1992). Folding and 
thrusting events are typical for the Birimian formations (e.g. Kadio et al. || The Kofi Supergroup is obliquely cut by the N-S to NNW trending Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone, 
whereas the Sadiola deposit occurs along the NNE striking Sadiola Fracture Zone (SFZ) (Robins, 
2006). The SFZ follows the steeply westerly dipping contact between greywacke to the west and 
impure carbonates to the east and its wallrock are intruded by discontinuous diorite and quartz-
feldspar-porphyry dykes (Hanssen et al., 1998; Robins, 2006). The Sadiola Hill deposit is also located at the margin of the inner and intermediate contact 
metamorphic aureole of the Alamoutala-Sekekoto plutonic system identified by (Hein and 
Tshibubudze, 2007b). Dating of the Alamoutala-Sekekoto granodiorite gave an age of 2083 ± 7 Ma 
and is taken as the age of gold mineralisation in the Sadiola goldfield (U-Pb zircon) (WAXI, 2013). Based on geophysical data, the plutonic system is interpreted to be situated directly below the Sadiola 
goldfield and is represented by projections of tonalite dykes in pits from the upper surface of the 
pluton, and it crops out at Alamoutala (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Alteration assemblages identified include calc-silicate, potassic, chlorite–calcite, carbonate and 
silicification with gold mainly associated with both arsenic and antimony dominated sulphide 
assemblages including arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, stibnite and gudmuntite (Hanssen et al., 1998; 
Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). || The carbonates 
include a massive, grey dolomite-marble and carbonaceous greywacke, and siltstone units which 
occur in a number of pits within the Sadiola goldfield (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). The igneous rocks at the Sadiola mine include diorite, lamprophyre dykes and quartz-feldspar 
porphyry. The diorite is composed of alkali-rich plagioclase and hornblende, and grades into coarse 
biotite-rich diorite which contains sulphides (Hanssen et al., 1998; Hein, 2008). This intrusion was 
characterized by Theron (1997a) as having similar composition as the TTG suite rocks, which are 
widespread across the WAC (WAXI, 2013). The quartz-feldspar-porphyry (QFP) dykes have been recorded in outcrop in the Sadiola opencast 
(Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a).The quartz porphyry host rare tourmaline crystals (Hanssen et al., 
1998). QFP dykes often intrude along steep west dipping, NNE trending faults and crosscut the 
diorites (Robins, 2006). || The main focus of this project has therefore been to derive an ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill 
gold deposit by contrasting the intrusion related style hypothesis proposed for the deposit by Theron 
(1997) with the shear-hosted style hypothesis proposed by Hanssen et al. (1998) using petrographic 
analysis. The features which will characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit (i.e. indicator minerals, 
alteration assemblage and mineral textures) will be used to contrast the two models and to establish a 
likely model for the deposit. 1.2 Location and Physiography 
The Sadiola Hill gold mine is situated in the Sadiola goldfield, in western Mali at about 77km south of 
the regional capital, Kayes, near the international border of Mali with Senegal (Fig.1). Mali is a

which have been intruded by a number of felsic intrusions. The metasedimentary rocks consist of fine 
grained greywacke and impure carbonates with minor tuffs and acid volcanics (Hanssen et al., 1998). These lithologies show evidence of macroscopic to mesoscopic slump structures (Hein and

compressions and the host rocks are generally regionally metamorphosed under low-to-mid 
greenschist facies conditions, and also the deposit is situated within and/or around a shear zone. Sulphide mineralisation is associated with shear fabrics. The mineral and sulphide textures observed 
in this study suggest that this is not the case for the Sadiola Hill deposit as there were no visible shear 
fabrics (foliation), compressional evidence and greenschist facies. However the Sadiola deposit does 
have few features which are similar to those of shear-hosted deposits, these are: (a) carbonate 
alteration, (b) sulphides hosted in and around tectonic structures and (c) host rocks are 
metamorphosed though in the Sadiola Hill deposit it was a result of contact metamorphism rather than 
regional metamorphism which generally occurs in shear-hosted deposit. The host rocks of the Sadiola Hill deposit have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and 
epidote-chlorite facies which indicates high temperature and low pressure conditions during 
metamorphism, i.e., contact metamorphism. Contact metamorphism occurred during cooling and

divided into two shields which are the Reguibat shield in the north and the Man shield in south (Potrel 
et al., 1998). These two shields are separated by the Taoudeni basin, which is Neoproterozoic to 
Devonian in age and are entirely surrounded by Pan African and Hercynian belts (Matthias et al. 2002). The Reguibat shield contains Palaeoproterozoic assemblages in the eastern part as well as 
Archean relicts which include kimberlites (Ennih and Liegeois, 2008). Large parts of the WAC in the 
Man Shield consist of Palaeoproterozoic rocks referred to as the Birimian Supergroup (Abouchami et 
al. 1990; Beziat et al., 2000). || Fig. 2: Geological sketch map showing major tectonic units of the West African Craton (After Boher

The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which 
is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises 
meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and 
marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two 
facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite 
and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part 
of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta-
sedimentary rocks.",Western Mali,llm

compressions and the host rocks are generally regionally metamorphosed under low-to-mid

in this study suggest that this is not the case for the Sadiola Hill deposit as there were no visible shear 
fabrics (foliation), compressional evidence and greenschist facies. However the Sadiola deposit does 
have few features which are similar to those of shear-hosted deposits, these are: (a) carbonate 
alteration, (b) sulphides hosted in and around tectonic structures and (c) host rocks are 
metamorphosed though in the Sadiola Hill deposit it was a result of contact metamorphism rather than 
regional metamorphism which generally occurs in shear-hosted deposit. The host rocks of the Sadiola Hill deposit have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and 
epidote-chlorite facies which indicates high temperature and low pressure conditions during 
metamorphism, i.e., contact metamorphism. Contact metamorphism occurred during cooling and

west), show an upward gradation and cross bedding at all scales, and are best developed to the west of 
the SFZ (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b; Boshoff et al., 1998). Carbonate rocks in the Sadiola deposit are impure marble which consists of alternating beds of dark

The Sadiola Hill gold mine is located within the Sadiola goldfield in the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier 
(KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC) and is situated in western Mali. The Sadiola 
goldfield is located close to the Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system and mineralisation 
has been shown to have a relationship with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and diorite dykes. The 
goldfield also hosts the FE3, FE4, Timbabougouni mines, and FE2 and Tambali prospects. The 
relative association of mineralisation with highly deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Birimian 
Supergroup makes it difficult to derive an ore genetic model. The model is important for regional and 
in-mine exploration, but also significant for understanding geologic evolution of the host rocks. A number of different ore genesis models have been proposed for Sadiola Hill deposit. || Fig. 2: Geological sketch map showing major tectonic units of the West African Craton (After Boher
