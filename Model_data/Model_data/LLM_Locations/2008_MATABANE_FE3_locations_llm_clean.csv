1.1 Preamble 
The FE3 open cast is situated in the Sadiola goldfield in Mali. The goldfield also includes the 
giant Sadiola and FE4 open casts which are mined by the Société d’Exploitation des Mines 
d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A.,  and  is  a  Joint  Venture  partnership  between  AngloGold  Ashanti, 
IAMGOLD, the Malian Government and the IFC. Gold production at Sadiola goldfield began 
in mid-1997: the FE3 open cast is currently in the feasibility stages. The  geology  and  metallogenic  setting  of  the  FE3  open  cast  has  not  been  investigated, 
mapped  or  researched  to  date. Therefore  the  relationship  between  the  stratigraphy, 
structures  and  intrusive  rocks  is  not  known,  but  it  is  considered  by  Sadiola  mine  geology 
team to be important in determining the tectonic setting and the timing of gold mineralization 
in the goldfield. Therefore  the  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  describe  the  stratigraphy,  structure  and 
intrusive rocks that occur in the goldfield.",FE4 open casts,llm

2.1 Preamble 
The West African craton has been divided into four major domains; the Reguibat Rise, the 
Leo-Man Rise, the Kayes Inlier and the Kéniéba Inlier (Liégeois et al., 1991; Thiéblemont et 
al.,  2004;  Dioh  et  al.,  2006)  (Fig. 2). The  domains  are  separated  by  the  Taoudeni  basin 
which  is  Phanerozoic  in  age  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The  Reguibat  and  the  Leo-Man  domains 
consist of an Archaean terrain in the west and a Palaeoproterozoic terrain in the east (Egal 
et al., 2002; Gueye et al., 2008). The Kéniéba and the Kayes Inliers are Palaeoproterozoic 
terrains (Liégeois et al., 1991) and the study area is situated in the Kéniéba Inlier in Mali. The  Kéniéba  Inlier  has  been  divided  into  the  Mako  Supergroup,  the  Dialé-Dalemé 
Supergroup,  Falemé  volcanic  belt  and  the  Kofi  Series  (Hirdes  et  al.,  2002)  (Fig. || Finally,  the  sediments  of  the  FE3  opencasts  (Kofi  Series)  have  not  been  dated  but  are 
interpreted as Birimian in age by Hirdes et al. (2002). The Birimian sequences of the West 
African  craton  are  dated  at  2238-2171  Ma  (Milési  et  al.,  1991,  1992;  Ledru  et  al.,  1991; 
Boher  et  al.,  1992). The  Birimian  sequences  are  composed  of  tholeiitic  basalts,  andesitic 
volcanic,  calc-alkaline  volcanics,  volcaniclastic  sediments,  detrital  sediments  and  chemical 
sediments which are characteristic of an oceanic island arc environment (Hirdes et al., 2002; 
Gueye  et  al.,  2008). In  contrast,  the  Birimian  sequences  of  the  Keniéba  Inlier  (i.e.,  Mako 
Supergroup;  Diale-Daleme  Supergroup;  Falemé  volcanic  belt)  are  dated  at  2063±41  Ma, 
2096±8  Ma  +  2099±4  Ma  (respectively). They  are  interpreted  as  remnants  of  an  oceanic 
island  arcs  terrane  that  was  accreted  onto  an  Archaean  continent  (Diallo,  2001;  Dia  et  al., 
1997). || Hirdes et al. (2002) concluded that andesite and felsic lava dominant the belt, 
but volcaniclastic units, chemical sediments (e.g., chert and manganiferous shale) and meta-
greywacke  also  occur  throughout  the  volcanic  belt. Hirdes  et  al. (2002)  interpreted  these 
sequences  as  proximal  volcanic  rocks. The  Falemé  volcanic  belt  is  associated  with  major 
skarn-type iron deposits (Schwartz et al., 2004). 2.6 Kofi Series

15 || The Birimian rocks of 
the  Kéniéba  Inlier  unconformably  overlie  the  Sandikounda  Amphibolite-Gneiss  (SAG) 
basement (Dia et al., 1997). The basement consists of dioritic to tonalitic rocks aged at 2194 
± 6 (Dia et al., 1997, Pb-Pb age; Pawlig et al., 2006, T DM Sm-Nd). The oldest Birimian rocks 
of  the  inlier  are  tholeiitic  basalts  and  andesites  of  the  Mako  Supergroup,  which 
unconformably overlie the SAG basement. These volcanic sequences are dated at 2195±11 
Ma (Dia et al, 1997; detrital zircons, Pb-Pb age) and at 2063±41 Ma (Abouchami, 1990; Sm-
Nd). The  Mako  Supergroup  is  overlain  by  the  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  which  consists  of 
Birimian sequences dated at 2096±8 Ma (Ledru et al, 1991; Pb-zircon evaporation; Hirdes et 
al.,  2002). The  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  is  overlain  by  the  Falemé  volcanic  belt  which  is 
dated at 2099±4 Ma (Hirdes et al., 2002; Pb-Pb age). || The Kofi Series, which outcrops only in 
Mali, overlies the volcanic belt and has not been dated (Dioh et al., 2006). The sequences are intruded by Eburnean granitoids aged at 2045±27 to 1973±33 Ma (Ledru 
et  al,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Pb-Pb;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006). The  post-Eburnean  age

10 || The Saraya batholith intrudes the Dialé-Dalemé Supergroup and includes the Balangouma 
and Boboti plutons (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Saraya batholith is composed of biotite-bearing 
tonalite to granite, while the Boboti and Balangoma plutons comprise gabbro to amphibole-
biotite bearing monzogranite (Dioh et al., 2006) that are dated at 1973±33 Ma (Ledru et al., 
1991; Rb-Sr). The Falemé volcanic belt is intruded by Na-rich, belt-type granitoids (Dioh et 
al., 2006). 2.8 Metamorphism 
During the Eburnean Orogeny, the Birimian meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary sequences 
of  the  Kéniéba  Inlier  were  subjected  to  regional  metamorphism  to  greenschist  facies 
(Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Debat  et  al.,  2003). The  contact  aureole  of 
granitoids  are  characterised  by  staurolite-sillimanite-garnet  mineral  assemblages  indicating 
that  metamorphism  reached  amphibolite  facies  in  grade  (Debat  et  al.,  2003;  Pawlig  et  al., 
2006). Peak metamorphic conditions reached 500-600 ˚C and 4-6 kbar and has been dated 
at approximately 2.1 Ga, which falls in the time interval of the Eburnean Orogeny (Hirdes et 
al., 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006, U-Pb age on sphene).",Faleme volcanic belt,llm

The  Mako  Supergroup  is  predominantly  composed  of  tholeiitic  pillowed  basalt  and  calc-
alkaline  andesite. These  meta-volcanic  rocks  are  inter-layered  with  immature  meta-
sedimentary and meta-volcaniclastic rocks (Hirdes et al., 2002; Dioh et al., 2006). 2.4 Dialé-Dalemé Supergroup 
The  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  is  composed  of  meta-sedimentary  sequences  inter-bedded 
with calc-alkaline volcanics (Pawlig et al., 2006). The meta-sedimentary sequences consist 
of intercalations of carbonate, volcaniclastic, siliciclastic and turbiditic units (Schwartz et al.,

et al., 2008). The 120 km long Badon-Kakadian batholith intrudes the Mako Supergroup and consists of 
numerous  TTG  suite  plutons  and  a  layered  plutonic  complex  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The 
complex  is  composed  of  werhlite,  pyroxenite,  gabbro  and  diorite  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008). The 
batholith  also  hosts  granitoids  that  are  dated  at  2199±68  Ma  (Bassot  and  Caen-Vachette, 
1984 in Ledru et al., 1991; Rb-Sr whole rock; Gueye et al., 2008). || 2.9 Regional Structure 
The  rocks  of  the  Kéniéba  Inlier  were  deformed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  at  2.1  Ga 
(Milési  et  al.,  1992). Two  major  strike-slip  shear  zones  dominate  the  Inlier;  the  Senegalo-
Malian Shear Zone and the Main Transcurrent Zone (Ledru et al, 1991) (Fig. 4). Ledru et al. 12 || 3). The 
Kéniéba Inlier is a Birimian terrain that was accreted during the Eburnean Orogeny at 2.2- 
2.0  Ga  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Gueye  et  al.,  2008). The  Eburnean 
Orogeny in the Kéniéba Inlier is characterized by the emplacement of calc-alkaline granitoids 
which  intruded  the  volcanic  and  sedimentary  sequences  of  the  inlier  (Leube  et  al.,  1990; 
Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The  post-Eburnean  Senegalo-Malian  graben  lies  east  of  the  Senegalo-
Mali Shear Zone and trends N-S (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Kofi Series overlies the graben in 
Mali; the series has not been dated. The stratigraphic succession of the Kéniéba Inlier is listed in Table 1. || Chapter 2: Regional geology 
2.1 Preamble 
The West African craton has been divided into four major domains; the Reguibat Rise, the 
Leo-Man Rise, the Kayes Inlier and the Kéniéba Inlier (Liégeois et al., 1991; Thiéblemont et 
al.,  2004;  Dioh  et  al.,  2006)  (Fig. 2). The  domains  are  separated  by  the  Taoudeni  basin 
which  is  Phanerozoic  in  age  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The  Reguibat  and  the  Leo-Man  domains 
consist of an Archaean terrain in the west and a Palaeoproterozoic terrain in the east (Egal 
et al., 2002; Gueye et al., 2008). The Kéniéba and the Kayes Inliers are Palaeoproterozoic 
terrains (Liégeois et al., 1991) and the study area is situated in the Kéniéba Inlier in Mali. The  Kéniéba  Inlier  has  been  divided  into  the  Mako  Supergroup,  the  Dialé-Dalemé 
Supergroup,  Falemé  volcanic  belt  and  the  Kofi  Series  (Hirdes  et  al.,  2002)  (Fig. || Figure 3: Simplified geology of the Kéniéba Inlier (Dioh et al., 2006)

18 || Finally,  the  sediments  of  the  FE3  opencasts  (Kofi  Series)  have  not  been  dated  but  are 
interpreted as Birimian in age by Hirdes et al. (2002). The Birimian sequences of the West 
African  craton  are  dated  at  2238-2171  Ma  (Milési  et  al.,  1991,  1992;  Ledru  et  al.,  1991; 
Boher  et  al.,  1992). The  Birimian  sequences  are  composed  of  tholeiitic  basalts,  andesitic 
volcanic,  calc-alkaline  volcanics,  volcaniclastic  sediments,  detrital  sediments  and  chemical 
sediments which are characteristic of an oceanic island arc environment (Hirdes et al., 2002; 
Gueye  et  al.,  2008). In  contrast,  the  Birimian  sequences  of  the  Keniéba  Inlier  (i.e.,  Mako 
Supergroup;  Diale-Daleme  Supergroup;  Falemé  volcanic  belt)  are  dated  at  2063±41  Ma, 
2096±8  Ma  +  2099±4  Ma  (respectively). They  are  interpreted  as  remnants  of  an  oceanic 
island  arcs  terrane  that  was  accreted  onto  an  Archaean  continent  (Diallo,  2001;  Dia  et  al.,

the  Kéniéba  Inlier  unconformably  overlie  the  Sandikounda  Amphibolite-Gneiss  (SAG)

± 6 (Dia et al., 1997, Pb-Pb age; Pawlig et al., 2006, T DM Sm-Nd). The oldest Birimian rocks 
of  the  inlier  are  tholeiitic  basalts  and  andesites  of  the  Mako  Supergroup,  which 
unconformably overlie the SAG basement. These volcanic sequences are dated at 2195±11 
Ma (Dia et al, 1997; detrital zircons, Pb-Pb age) and at 2063±41 Ma (Abouchami, 1990; Sm-
Nd). The  Mako  Supergroup  is  overlain  by  the  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  which  consists  of 
Birimian sequences dated at 2096±8 Ma (Ledru et al, 1991; Pb-zircon evaporation; Hirdes et 
al.,  2002). The  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  is  overlain  by  the  Falemé  volcanic  belt  which  is 
dated at 2099±4 Ma (Hirdes et al., 2002; Pb-Pb age). || The Saraya batholith intrudes the Dialé-Dalemé Supergroup and includes the Balangouma 
and Boboti plutons (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Saraya batholith is composed of biotite-bearing 
tonalite to granite, while the Boboti and Balangoma plutons comprise gabbro to amphibole-
biotite bearing monzogranite (Dioh et al., 2006) that are dated at 1973±33 Ma (Ledru et al., 
1991; Rb-Sr). The Falemé volcanic belt is intruded by Na-rich, belt-type granitoids (Dioh et 
al., 2006). 2.8 Metamorphism 
During the Eburnean Orogeny, the Birimian meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary sequences 
of  the  Kéniéba  Inlier  were  subjected  to  regional  metamorphism  to  greenschist  facies 
(Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Debat  et  al.,  2003). The  contact  aureole  of 
granitoids  are  characterised  by  staurolite-sillimanite-garnet  mineral  assemblages  indicating 
that  metamorphism  reached  amphibolite  facies  in  grade  (Debat  et  al.,  2003;  Pawlig  et  al., 
2006). Peak metamorphic conditions reached 500-600 ˚C and 4-6 kbar and has been dated 
at approximately 2.1 Ga, which falls in the time interval of the Eburnean Orogeny (Hirdes et 
al., 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006, U-Pb age on sphene). || The quartz and plagioclase 
crystals  are  subhedral  while  biotite  grains  are  anhedral. The  granodiorite  is  medium-
crystalline  and  extensively  altered  (Fig. 12). In  places  the  dykes  have  been  heavily 
weathered leaving a potassium-feldspar-rich residue. The dykes are interpreted to connect 
with  the  Sekokoto  pluton  (Fig. 13),  at  depth  because  the  pluton  underlies  the  Sadiola 
goldfield  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a)  as  determined  from  aeromagnetic  data  of  the 
Kenieba Inlier (north sun angle). || There  are  two  phases  of  mineralisation  in  the  study  area. (a)  Primary  hydrothermal 
mineralisation: Gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies 
consists  of  arsenopyrite-pyrite-gold  assemblages; 
(b)  Secondary  placer  gold 
mineralisation. 9. A laterite profile covers the study area to a thickness of more than 2 metres 
10. The considerable difference between the ages given for the Birimian sequences of the 
West  African  craton  and  those  of  the  Kenieba  Inlier  could  indicate  that  the  slump, 
olistostrome,  turbidite,  siltstone-greywacke  and  greywacke  sediments  of  the  FE3 
opencasts were derived from the erosion of the Birimian terrane. 44 || There  is  a  considerable  difference  between  the  ages  given  for  the  Birimian 
sequences of the West African craton and those of the Kenieba Inlier as indicated in Fig 22 
and accord better, but are still younger, than those of the Tarkwa Group (2149-2132 Ma; U-
Pb  zircon,  Davis  et  al.,  1994)  which  unconformably  overlies  the  Birimian. It  is  therefore 
suggested  that  the  slump,  olistostrome,  turbidite,  siltstone-greywacke  and  greywacke 
sediments of the FE3 opencasts were derived from the erosion of the Birimian terrane. 5.2 Gold bearing breccias and veins 
The  structures  that  host  mineralisation  in  the  region  are  breccia  and  quartz-arsenopyrite 
veins that crosscut the stratigraphy, which implies that gold mineralisation is younger than 
the  sedimentary  units. The  mineralised  breccias  (and  associated  alteration,  Fig. 21)  occur 
around contact aureole of the granodiorite. This may imply that the mineralisation is related 
to the intrusion of the granodiorite as has been established in the nearby Sadiola deposit by 
Hein and Tshibubudze (2007b). || may be the result of dissolution and re-precipitation related to fluid movement. This suggest 
that there was fluid circulation associated with the granodiorite however is not clear whether 
the fluids are contact metamorphic or magmatic. The  Kéniéba  Inlier  was  intruded  by  granitoids  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. Two  major 
magmatic  events  have  been  identified  in  the  Inlier;  at  2.16-2.11  Ga  and  at  2.08-2.07  Ga 
(Gueye et al., 2008). 5.3 Secondary placer gold mineralisation

The FE3 open cast is located in the Sadiola area in Mali, West Africa. The Sadiola goldfield 
is located 80 km west of the capital city of Bamako on the western border of Senegal and 
Mali  (Fig. 1). Mali  is  a  landlocked,  Sahel  country  and  is  mostly  semi-desert  or  desert. || Chapter 1: Introduction 
1.1 Preamble 
The FE3 open cast is situated in the Sadiola goldfield in Mali. The goldfield also includes the 
giant Sadiola and FE4 open casts which are mined by the Société d’Exploitation des Mines 
d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A.,  and  is  a  Joint  Venture  partnership  between  AngloGold  Ashanti, 
IAMGOLD, the Malian Government and the IFC. Gold production at Sadiola goldfield began 
in mid-1997: the FE3 open cast is currently in the feasibility stages. The  geology  and  metallogenic  setting  of  the  FE3  open  cast  has  not  been  investigated, 
mapped  or  researched  to  date. Therefore  the  relationship  between  the  stratigraphy, 
structures  and  intrusive  rocks  is  not  known,  but  it  is  considered  by  Sadiola  mine  geology 
team to be important in determining the tectonic setting and the timing of gold mineralization 
in the goldfield. Therefore  the  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  describe  the  stratigraphy,  structure  and 
intrusive rocks that occur in the goldfield. || In the 16th century, the Gold Coast of West 
Africa accounted for 35% of the entire world’s gold production although gold production had 
decreased  significantly  since  that  time  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008). Major  gold  deposits  occur  in 
Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali. The Ghanaian gold province is the largest in West Africa and 
is considered a world-class gold deposit region (Komla, 1993). Ghana and Mali are currently 
the second and third largest gold producers in Africa, respectively (Middleton, 2007). Three  types  of  primary  deposit  have  been  distinguished  in  West  Africa;  pre-orogenic 
stratiform  deposits;  syn-orogenic  deposits;  late-orogenic  discordant  mesothermal  gold 
mineralization  (Milési  et  al.,  1992). Pre-orogenic  stratiform  deposits  have  been  reported  in 
the  Loulo  district  of  Mali,  which  hosts  tourmalinised  turbidite. || Malaria and other arthropod-borne diseases prevail in Mali and high rates of children suffer 
from malnutrition. Mali is very poor and one of the poorest countries in the world. Mining  is  a  significant  component  to  Mali’s  economy  and  accounted  for  26%  of  gross 
domestic product (GDP) in 2005, with gold mining accounting for 80% of mining activity (US 
Department of State, 2008 ). 1.3 Aims and objectives 
The  main  objective  of  the  project  is  to  define  the  stratigraphy  in  the  study  area  by  sub-
dividing the facies successions. Furthermore, detailed mapping of structures (if present) will 
be  done  with  the  purpose  of  determining  the  relative  timing  of  structural  events. Another 
objective  of  the  project  will  be  mapping  of  the  intrusive  bodies  and  determining  their 
relationship to stratigraphy and structure. || The Kofi Series, which outcrops only in 
Mali, overlies the volcanic belt and has not been dated (Dioh et al., 2006). The sequences are intruded by Eburnean granitoids aged at 2045±27 to 1973±33 Ma (Ledru 
et  al,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Pb-Pb;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006). The  post-Eburnean  age

identified  in  the  Kéniéba  Inlier;  at  2.16-2.11  Ga  and  at  2.08-2.07  Ga  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008). The  early  magmatic  event  resulted  in  the  emplacement  of  the  Badon-Kakadian  batholith; 
then later resulted in the emplacement of the late granitoids of the Saraya batholith (Gueye 
et al., 2008). The 120 km long Badon-Kakadian batholith intrudes the Mako Supergroup and consists of 
numerous  TTG  suite  plutons  and  a  layered  plutonic  complex  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The 
complex  is  composed  of  werhlite,  pyroxenite,  gabbro  and  diorite  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008). The 
batholith  also  hosts  granitoids  that  are  dated  at  2199±68  Ma  (Bassot  and  Caen-Vachette, 
1984 in Ledru et al., 1991; Rb-Sr whole rock; Gueye et al., 2008). || The Saraya batholith intrudes the Dialé-Dalemé Supergroup and includes the Balangouma 
and Boboti plutons (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Saraya batholith is composed of biotite-bearing 
tonalite to granite, while the Boboti and Balangoma plutons comprise gabbro to amphibole-
biotite bearing monzogranite (Dioh et al., 2006) that are dated at 1973±33 Ma (Ledru et al., 
1991; Rb-Sr). The Falemé volcanic belt is intruded by Na-rich, belt-type granitoids (Dioh et 
al., 2006). 2.8 Metamorphism 
During the Eburnean Orogeny, the Birimian meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary sequences 
of  the  Kéniéba  Inlier  were  subjected  to  regional  metamorphism  to  greenschist  facies 
(Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Debat  et  al.,  2003). The  contact  aureole  of 
granitoids  are  characterised  by  staurolite-sillimanite-garnet  mineral  assemblages  indicating 
that  metamorphism  reached  amphibolite  facies  in  grade  (Debat  et  al.,  2003;  Pawlig  et  al., 
2006). Peak metamorphic conditions reached 500-600 ˚C and 4-6 kbar and has been dated 
at approximately 2.1 Ga, which falls in the time interval of the Eburnean Orogeny (Hirdes et 
al., 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006, U-Pb age on sphene).",Saraya batholith,llm
