1.1. Preamble 
Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in

2.1. Stratigraphy 
The West African Craton (WAC) is made up of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks and is 
divided  into  the  Reguibat  Rise  in  the  north  and  the  Leo-Man  Rise  in  the  south  (Thiéblemont  et  al., 
2004)  (Figure  1.1). The  Leo-Man  consists  of  two  domains,  namely  the  Archaean  Kénema-Man 
domain  (3.54  Ga)  in  the  southwest  and the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (2.3-1.8  Ga)  in 
the  east  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006),  with  the  exception  of  the  Kénieba-  Kédougou  and  Kayes  Inliers, 
located  between  Mali  and  Senegal  (Figure  1.1). The  Birimian  Supergroup  makes  up  part  of  the 
Baoulé-Mossi  domain  and  was  deposited  ca. 2.3  Ga  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).",Baoule-Mossi domain,llm

Effusive eruptions are typical of basaltic liquids, particularly when submerged beneath the confining 
water column. Effusive eruptions are characterized by the ability of lava to flow (low viscosity) rather 
than explode (Parfitt and Wilson, 2008) because volatiles escape passively through vesicle formation 
(McPhie et al., 1993; Bardintzeff and McBirney, 2000; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). The  coherent  and  autoclastic  facies  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  proximally  to  the  volcanic 
source. However, because basaltic lavas have low viscosities, they are able to flow laterally between 
tens and hundreds of metres before solidification.",Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa,llm

ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || 1.6. Limitations of the study 
A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political 
instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were 
restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against 
unnecessary  travel. The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area. However,  a 
comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano-
sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study. 21 || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages 
that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally, 
the  manganese-
carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary 
sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the 
Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich 
carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to 
classify the samples in order to characterize the tectonic setting for volcanic rocks of the GB. Geochemical data for volcanic rocks from the Boromo and Houndé belts, Oudalan-Gorouol belt 
and Tiebélé belt  were used in a comparative study of volcanic units across several different belts in 
Burkina Faso. Data from Baratoux et al. (2011) include 7 tholeiitic basalt samples and 6 calc-alkaline 
volcanic samples that were reported for the Boromo and Houndé belts in western Burkina Faso. Data 
from Ilboudo (2010) were reported for the Tiebélé region in the south of the country. Tshibubudze and 
Hein  (2013)  reported  data  for  two  meta-volcanic  samples  (major-elements  only)  from  the  Oudalan-
Gorouol belt (OGB) in the northeast of Burkina Faso. || LIST OF FIGURES

Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely

Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger 
and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the 
Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average 
daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and 
northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages 
that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally, 
the  manganese-
carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary 
sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the 
Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich 
carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || Vidal and Alric (1994) 
interpreted that the basaltic sequences were the product of back-arc basin volcanism. Pouclet et al. (1996) and Hirdes et al. (1996) described two major periods of volcanism for the 
WAC from two discrete but juxtaposed volcano-(sedimentary) belts in northeast Cote d’Ivoire;

proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)

chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages

1.5. Thesis Organisation 
This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:- 
(1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related 
ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || 2.4. Metallogenesis 
Metallogenesis in the northeast of Burkina Faso includes gold, diamonds,  Mn-Fe, silver, lead, 
molybdenum,  copper  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1992;  Hein  et  al.,  2004; 
Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). In  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  belt,  manganese  deposits  occur  at  Tambão  and 
Billiata  (Figure  1.1)  and  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  the  Tin  Edia  deposit. Gold  occurrences 
include  commercially  mined  goldfields  such  as  Essakane,  Inata  and  Taparko  goldfields,  as  well  as 
artisanally mined deposits such as Falagountou artisanal mine. They occur as shear and quartz vein-
hosted deposits. Diamondiferous lamproite and lamprophyre plugs and dykes crop out NNW of Kaya 
in the Pissila batholith in the Barsalogo diamond field, with rare kimberlite pipes (WAXI, 2013). || A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to 
classify the samples in order to characterize the tectonic setting for volcanic rocks of the GB. Geochemical data for volcanic rocks from the Boromo and Houndé belts, Oudalan-Gorouol belt 
and Tiebélé belt  were used in a comparative study of volcanic units across several different belts in 
Burkina Faso. Data from Baratoux et al. (2011) include 7 tholeiitic basalt samples and 6 calc-alkaline 
volcanic samples that were reported for the Boromo and Houndé belts in western Burkina Faso. Data 
from Ilboudo (2010) were reported for the Tiebélé region in the south of the country. Tshibubudze and 
Hein  (2013)  reported  data  for  two  meta-volcanic  samples  (major-elements  only)  from  the  Oudalan-
Gorouol belt (OGB) in the northeast of Burkina Faso. || The  GB  rocks  plot 
within the basalt, basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts 
are distributed throughout the basalt, basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. The Tiebélé samples 
have a smaller SiO2 range but some samples contain increased alkali concentrations and plot as 
trachyandesite and tephrite. The Oudalan-Gorouol belt samples plot between basalt and basaltic-
andesite. (d)  SiO2  versus K2O  (wt%) demonstrates  that the  GB  volcanic rocks  plot  within the 
Low-K series for the most part. One sample plots in the Medium-K series with a K2O value of 
~1 wt%. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG 
granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006; 
Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || The Essakane, Falagountou, Taparko and Inata goldfields are 
represented in north-northeast of Burkina Faso. The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the 
Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The 
Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt. Figure 2.1. The Goren volcano-sedimentary belt is presented showing the locations of Kaya, Mané, 
Guilla, Korsimoro, Sirgui artisanal mine and Tangapella hill. Northwest and northeast trending 
shears  and  thrusts  are  represented  as  well  as  WNW  trending  shears  of  the  Wabo-Tampelse 
Event. || The GB rocks plot within the basalt,

2013), and in the Pissila batholith in the Saaba region (Simoko, 2012). Three deformation events are recognised in northeast Burkina Faso:

Metallogenesis in the northeast of Burkina Faso includes gold, diamonds,  Mn-Fe, silver, lead, 
molybdenum,  copper  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1992;  Hein  et  al.,  2004;

Billiata  (Figure  1.1)  and  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  the  Tin  Edia  deposit. Gold  occurrences 
include  commercially  mined  goldfields  such  as  Essakane,  Inata  and  Taparko  goldfields,  as  well  as 
artisanally mined deposits such as Falagountou artisanal mine. They occur as shear and quartz vein-
hosted deposits. Diamondiferous lamproite and lamprophyre plugs and dykes crop out NNW of Kaya 
in the Pissila batholith in the Barsalogo diamond field, with rare kimberlite pipes (WAXI, 2013). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal 
activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993; 
Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher 
concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions 
proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen 
throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS 
mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4) 
in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena-
chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages 
that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally, 
the  manganese-
carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary 
sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the 
Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich 
carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || The Essakane, Falagountou, Taparko and Inata goldfields are represented in north-northeast of

reserve  of  15  Mt  of  manganese  ore  divided  between  primary  and  supergene  manganese  resources

represent  a  prograding  delta  front  adjacent  to  a  shelf  margin. This  is  supported  by  fining  upwards 
sequences interpreted to represent various incomplete, small-scale Bouma sequences (Bouma, 1962). Turbidite flows can account for large  volumes of sediment deposition in a short period of time, thus

juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology,

This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:- 
(1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related 
ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG 
granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006; 
Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013).",West Africa,llm

2.1. Stratigraphy 
The West African Craton (WAC) is made up of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks and is 
divided  into  the  Reguibat  Rise  in  the  north  and  the  Leo-Man  Rise  in  the  south  (Thiéblemont  et  al., 
2004)  (Figure  1.1). The  Leo-Man  consists  of  two  domains,  namely  the  Archaean  Kénema-Man 
domain  (3.54  Ga)  in  the  southwest  and the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (2.3-1.8  Ga)  in 
the  east  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006),  with  the  exception  of  the  Kénieba-  Kédougou  and  Kayes  Inliers, 
located  between  Mali  and  Senegal  (Figure  1.1). The  Birimian  Supergroup  makes  up  part  of  the 
Baoulé-Mossi  domain  and  was  deposited  ca. 2.3  Ga  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).",West African Craton,llm

1.1. Preamble 
Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in 
Ghana  (Kitson,  1918)  and  were  classified  as  tholeiitic  basalts  and  calc-alkaline  lavas. || ABSTRACT 
The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Figure  1.1. Volcano-sedimentary  belts  of  southeast  and  northeast  Burkina  Faso  and  northwestern  Ghana. Volcano-

Faso, southwest of Ouagadougou. || Petrographically,  lithologically  and  geochemically,  back-arc  and/or  intra-arc  basin  basalts 
settings are extremely difficult to distinguish, especially in ancient terranes  (Pearce, 1996;  Väisänen 
and Westerlund, 2007). It was suggested by Pearce (1996) that back-arc and/or intra-arc basin basalts 
should be referred to as transitional between back-arc basin basalts and intra-arc tholeiites (IAT) when 
geochemical  evidence  cannot  ascertain  the  correct  tectonic  setting. This  has  been  that  rationale 
adopted in this thesis. 7.3. The Goren belt in a regional context 
In  northeast  Burkina  Faso,  geochemical  analyses  of  of  volcanic  rocks  from  various  belts, 
including the Oudalan-Gorouol, Bouroum-Yalogo and Goren volcano-sedimentary belts suggest that 
deposition of supracrustal rocks occurred in island arc terranes, followed by the accretion of multiple 
arcs (WAXI,  2013). Vidal  et  al. || The  Palaeoproterozoic  Birimian  Supergroup  was  systematically  intruded  by  a  suite  of  TTG 
granitoids, diorite and leucogranite plutons (Pons et al., 1995; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et al., 2006; 
Vidal  et  al.,  2009). TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the 
Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the 
Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis, 
2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in 
West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994; 
Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba 
et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup 
(2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids 
(2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in 
the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian 
Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || greenschist facies at most (WAXI, 2013). Regional metamorphism in the Eburnean Orogeny attained

development of chlorite, muscovite, epidote and actinolite mineral assemblages, and low to medium 
grade amphibolite facies with the introduction of hornblende (Bossière et al., 1996; Béziat et al., 2000; 
Debat et al., 2003; Naba et al., 2004). Granulite facies metamorphic rocks  crop out in the Oudalan-
Gorouol belt on the margin of the Dori batholith in the Gorom Gorom region (Tshibubudze and Hein, 
2013), and in the Pissila batholith in the Saaba region (Simoko, 2012). Three deformation events are recognised in northeast Burkina Faso:

lavas of the southern GB are interpreted to have formed in relatively shallow water, due to their high 
vesicle abundance, and perhaps only a few hundred meters water depth (cf. Jones, 1969). The vesicles 
indicate  movement  of  gas  toward  flow  boundaries,  particularly  the  top  of  flow  units;  for  example, 
Archaean subaqueous basalts in Quebec were identified by Dimroth et al. (1978) with an abundance of

2013_Peters.txt,"18,3","ABSTRACT 
The  Palaeoproterozoic  southern  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  of  northeast  Burkina  Faso 
represents a sequence/package of rocks formed in a back-arc basin environment. Evidence is based on 
a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style 
basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and 
trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the 
occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised 
concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as 
well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic 
of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits, 
siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed 
of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Distal 
versus proximal facies and coherent versus volcaniclastic facies can be interpreted using lithological 
relationships, volcanic textures and rock composition. For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern 
Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano-
sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with 
Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were 
leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and 
concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative 
processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the 
same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be 
juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology, 
sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic 
environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1) 
where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are 
intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe  
bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010). || The belt is weakly to moderately metamorphosed, giving 
a  unique  opportunity  to study  relatively  pristine  volcanic textures and  establish  volcanic  facies. The 
volcano-sedimentary  units  have  been  mapped,  sampled  in  detail  and  analysed  both  petrographically 
and  geochemically. From  field  studies,  geological  and  volcanic  facies  maps  were  created. This 
information  has  been  used  to  interpret  volcanic  setting. The  metallogenic  potential  of  the  southern 
Goren volcano-sedimentary belt has also been assessed in this study. 18",southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt,llm

al., 1992; Pouclet et al., 1996; Arndt et al., 1997; Lompo, 2009). Mg-rich tholeiites and calc-alkaline 
lavas  were  also  described  by  Dia  et  al. (1997)  from  the  Kénieba-Kédougou  Inlier  of  western  Mali. Blanchot et al. (1972), Béssoles (1977), Wright (1985), Abouchami et al.",western Mali,llm

equivalent volcanic products but geochronologically younger at approximately 2105 Ma (U-Pb zircon) 
(Hirdes et al., 1996). Despite  these  investigations,  surprisingly  little  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  volcanic 
sequences  at  the  scale  of  one  or  several  belts  in  West  Africa. Few  studies  have  been  conducted  on 
volcanic facies and metal potential in terms of base metals and Mn mineralisation, but delineating the 
volcanic facies and alteration zones  of volcanic belts can help in identifying and targeting volcanic-
related mineral deposits. For example, the Mount Reid volcanics in western Tasmania and the Abitibi 
greenstone  belt  of  central  Canada  are  both  regions  where  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide 
mineralization  has  been  found. Their  volcanic  facies  and  alteration  zones  are  well  understood, 
providing spatial constraints to economic mineralization (McPhie et al., 1993; Piché and Jébrak 2006). Delineating facies is also important in developing tectonic models for volcanic terranes. || Hyaloclastites 
and flow breccias indicate autoclastic facies, which often occur  near coherent lavas (Lajoie and Stix, 
1992). Lavas can develop numerous textures, most because of cooling, such as those observed in the 
GB (e.g., hyaloclastites, jointing and volcanic glass). For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well 
preserved volcanic textures where the rocks are not strongly altered by hydrothermal processes and/or 
deformed  (McPhie  and  Allen,  2003). An  example  of  this  is  the  devitrification  of  volcanic  glass,  as 
described  by  McPhie  and  Allen  (op  cit.,  2003);  crystal  boundaries  remain  intact  and  the  glass 
recrystallises as zeolites with a minor proportion of clay minerals. As a further example, metamorphosed Triassic basalt lavas in NW Croatia were interpreted as 
proximal  to intermediate  facies  by  Palinkaš  et  al. (2008)  based  on  volcanic textures  such  as  closely 
packed  pillows,  hyaloclastite,  pepperite  and  tortoise-shell  jointing.",western Tasmania,llm
