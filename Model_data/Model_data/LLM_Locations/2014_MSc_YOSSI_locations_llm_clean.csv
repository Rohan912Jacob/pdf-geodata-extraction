siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,

zone 5 model and correspond to high magnetic susceptibility values in and adjacent to the Banifing 
shear zone (Figure 5.20). The overall shear trend can be defined as northeasterly but internal north-
northeast  trending  rock  volumes  form  right-handed  (clockwise)  sigmoids  that  are  consistent  with

Northerly trending rocks volumes occur in the Kolondieba belt in the west of zone 5, and in the

and depth projection) (Table 5.1). The bodies 2 and 4  are  similar in parameters,  and different  from 
body  1. However,  bodies  2,  3,  4,  5,  6  are  located  in  the  Banifing  shear  zone. || According to the magnetic susceptibility and density, bodies 2, 3 and 5 are different from bodies

greater for the Yanfolila shear zone than the Banifing shear zone. The difference of source depth is 
due to the presence of sedimentary cover rocks along transect 1 to 1100m, and 850m for transect 2 
and  3. Importantly  the  data  shows  that  the  cover  sequences  postdate  activity  on  the  shear  zones 
suggesting that the shear zones were truncated and unconformably overlain by younger sedimentary 
cover  rocks. The  low  magnetic  susceptibility  and  high  density  along  transect  1  is  interpreted  to  be 
related to the thickness of the sedimentary cover rocks. The higher density may be due to compaction 
effects. || The magnetic and gravity inversion sections of model 5 are presented in Figures 5.21-5.22. The 
inversion  sections demonstrate that  the Banifing  shear  zone is steeply  dipping to  the  west  and  east. According to the magnetic section, the rock volumes are located at approximately 500-700m depth. According to gravity sections (Figure 5.22), high density rocks are located in the northern part of 
model  5  at  depth;  they  are  not  crosscut  by  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  may  represent  younger 
intrusions. A high density region in the northwest of zone 5 in the Kolondieba belt could be due to the

The inversion of key zone 5 is presented in Figure 5.20. Key zone 5 is located in the central east 
of the study area on the widest part of the Banifing shear zone and includes the Madina fault and the

coincidence of high susceptibility and high density corresponds to gneissic rocks identified with the 
surface  rock  petrophysics  measurements. Area  2  is  located  in  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  is  also 
interpreted as a gneissic rock volume. 46 || This was established 
by Wijns (2009) in a comparative study between the magnetic and electromagnetic methods as used in

by Wijns (2009) in a comparative study between the magnetic and electromagnetic methods as used in

readily resolved from electromagnetic data. The host rocks in the Syama belt are highly conductive 
because of graphite in the host rocks, relative to the intrusive bodies which are less conductive. Furthermore, a study completed by Féménias (2008) of the Banifing shear zone highlighted that 
basement  rock  lineaments  are  well  resolved  in  the  magnetic  and  radiometric  airborne  geophysical

Shield  in  the  south  (Figure  1.1). These  shields  represent  two  nuclei  which  formed  in  two  stages  of 
crustal  evolution  in  West  Africa  (Naba,  2007). The  shields  are  overlain  by  three  main  sedimentary 
basins; the  Tindouf basin in  the north,  the  Taoudeni basin in  the  centre, and  the Volta basin in  the 
southeast of the craton. The  West  African  craton  is  considered  as  stable  since  the  end  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic  at 
approximately 1.8 Ga (Kusnir et al., 1999).",West African Craton,llm

greater for the Yanfolila shear zone than the Banifing shear zone. The difference of source depth is 
due to the presence of sedimentary cover rocks along transect 1 to 1100m, and 850m for transect 2 
and  3. Importantly  the  data  shows  that  the  cover  sequences  postdate  activity  on  the  shear  zones

effects. || The results of the inversions enabled

susceptibility rock volumes generally trend north-northeast across zone 2 and are bounded by shears. Geometric elements such as dip, depth of structures and width were determined for the magmatic

from which the geometry of structures was calculated. Transect lines selected included:  
  Transect 1 (AA’) from GPS coordinates 570950E and 1245150N to 616000E and 1245150N, 
and  measures  approximately  45km  in  length. It  transects  the  Yanfolila  belt,  Yanfolila  shear 
zone, Madiana-Yanfolila fault, and the Kalana-Kodieran fold in the west central region of the 
study area (Figure 4.13).",west central region of the study area,llm

of airborne data interpretation in reconstruction of the geology of southwest Burkina Faso where for 
the most part, there is little outcrop. It was possible to resolve lithology and structures. The  study  in  the  Gawler  craton  in  Australia  by  Stewart  and  Betts  (2010)  was  based  on  the 
analysis  of  shear  zones  with  interpretation  of  the  geophysical  data  by  direct  modelling. Geological 
data was used as a constraint in building the forward model. The results of this study demonstrated 
that  interpretations  by  forward  modelling,  across  large  regions  with  little  or  absent  outcrop,  can  be 
extremely useful when building tectonic models. In  a  similar  way,  this  study  will use  large-scale geophysical  airborne data  for interpretation by 
modelling  of  southern  Mali  into  northeast  Guinea,  as  a  case  study  region,  where  there  is  currently 
limited geological data.",west of Burkina Faso,llm

northeast (Figure 5.9). According to the gravity data inversion, high density rock volumes are located 
in  the  western  region  of  the  inversion  adjacent  to  the  Yanfolila  shear  zone  (Figure  5.9). High 
susceptibility rock volumes generally trend north-northeast across zone 2 and are bounded by shears. Geometric elements such as dip, depth of structures and width were determined for the magmatic 
and gravity inversion sections of zone 2 (Figures 5.10-5.11). The majority of high susceptibility rocks 
dip  steeply  to  the  east,  as  do  their  bounding  shear  zones.",western region of the inversion,llm

that region. North-northeast trend rock volumes in the magnetic data resolve high density values in 
the north and south of the inversion (Figure 5.6) that probably correspond with basalt andesite rocks. The Yanfolila shear zone is characterised by two parallel trends and the presence of a close upright 
symmetric  fold  in  the  south on  the inversion. A  number of  southeast  trending  splay  shears are  also 
evident. Geometric elements such as dip, depth of structures and rocks volumes were determined for the 
magmatic and gravity inversion sections of zone 1 (Figures 5.7-5.8). The Yanfolila shear zone dips
