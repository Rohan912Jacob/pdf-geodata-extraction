orientation associated with D1 are recorded in the study area. This deformation is termed the Tangaean 
Event and formed during the NE-SW shortening period. Quartz veins formed during this event and their

Two  deformation  events  are  recorded  for  the  study  areas  in  the  Sadiola  deposit. These  are  interpreted 
from  equal  area  stereographic  projections  of  bedding  and  the  discontinuous,  parallel  cleavage  in  the 
metasedimentary  rocks. The  equal  area  stereographic  projections  of  bedding  from  the  Helicopter  Pit 
records  a  calculated  mean  bedding  of  336o/64oE  with  a  calculated  mean  for  the  west  high-wall  of 
350o/51oW. The  spread  of  the  data  around  the  primitive  circles  is  related  to  folding  about  a  NNW-
trending  fold  axes  (F1)  and  refolding  of  F1  about  the  ENE-ESE  trending  fold  axes  (F2). Bedding  is 
rotated against minor faults (Fig. 6). || A

cleavage of 343o/54E, however the data can be resolved into two data sets: a NNW trending set and a NE-
trending set (Fig. 7). Two sets of cleavages were also observed by Hein (2009) in which the ENE trending 
sets  (S2)  cross-cuts  the  NNW-trending  sets  (S1). Unfortunately  this  cross-cutting  relationship  has  not 
been observed in the study area, but is accepted by the mine as a tectonic sequence for the Sadiola pit. || Rose diagrams for quartz veins from the Helicopter Pit and the west high-wall are presented in Figure 8.

while  the  dominant  trend of  the  quartz  veins in  the  west  high-wall  is NNE  with  the  sub-ordinate trend 
towards NNW. The quartz veins elsewhere in the main pit are folded by F2 (Hein, 2009) indicating that 
the  veins  formed  prior  to  S2. The  relationship  between  S1  in  the  Helicopter  Pit  and  the  dominant 
orientation of quartz veins suggest that they formed at the same time during the NE directed compression. This is because bedding and cleavage verge towards NE. A

The West African Craton (Fig. 2) is a piece of continental crust that has been stable since approximately 
1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The 
Reguibat Rise and the Man terrains are composed of Archaean to Proterozoic rock formations (Potrel et 
al., 1998) with the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Man shield referred to as the Birimian sequence (Beziat 
et al., 2000). The Kêniêba and Kayes inliers are situated towards the western border of Senegal and Mali (Fig.",Kayes inlier,llm

WAC crops out in western Mali in what is known as the Kedougou-Kêniêba Inlier (Dia et al., 1997). The

Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) in the West African Craton can be divided into three distinct domains:

domains are separated by the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (SMF) while the central and western domains 
are separated by the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone (MTZ) (Fig. 3). The  geology  of  these  domains  is  defined  largely  by  Boshoff  et  al. (1989),  Ledru  et al. || 3.2 The Geology of the Sadiola opencast mine and the Sadiola deposit

greywacke,  alternating  greywacke-shale  units,  impure  carbonates  which  were  folded  and  contain 
limestone beds, siltstone, minor tuff and volcanoclastics units (Boshoff et al, 1998; Hanssen et al., 1998; 
Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). Jordaan et al. (1994) indicated that calcitic marbles occur in the Kofi 
Formation. The Sadiola goldfield consists of greywacke, siltstone, marble, carbonaceous to volcanoclastic 
greywacke  and  BIF  shale  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). The  goldfield  occurs  along  a  marble-
greywacke contact located east of the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (Hanssen et al., 1998). The greywacke units of the Sadiola goldfield are best developed to the west of the Sadiola Fracture Zone,

1.1  Preamble 
The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3 
and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société 
d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit 
(Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001). || Figure. 3: A simplified geological map of the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier showing the location of the study

The West African Craton (Fig. 2) is a piece of continental crust that has been stable since approximately 
1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The 
Reguibat Rise and the Man terrains are composed of Archaean to Proterozoic rock formations (Potrel et 
al., 1998) with the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Man shield referred to as the Birimian sequence (Beziat 
et al., 2000). The Kêniêba and Kayes inliers are situated towards the western border of Senegal and Mali (Fig.",Kenieba inlier,llm

The  Kofi  Formation  of  the  Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  is  dominated  by  fine-grained  carbonaceous 
greywacke,  alternating  greywacke-shale  units,  impure  carbonates  which  were  folded  and  contain 
limestone beds, siltstone, minor tuff and volcanoclastics units (Boshoff et al, 1998; Hanssen et al., 1998; 
Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). Jordaan et al. (1994) indicated that calcitic marbles occur in the Kofi 
Formation. The Sadiola goldfield consists of greywacke, siltstone, marble, carbonaceous to volcanoclastic 
greywacke  and  BIF  shale  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). The  goldfield  occurs  along  a  marble-
greywacke contact located east of the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (Hanssen et al., 1998). The greywacke units of the Sadiola goldfield are best developed to the west of the Sadiola Fracture Zone, 
while impure carbonates are best developed to the east. || Abstract 
Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold 
deposit. The  Sadiola  open  cast  occurs  with  the  FE3  and  FE4  open  cast  within  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments 
which  were  metamorphosed  and  deformed  during  the  2.1  –  1.9 Ga  Eburnean  orogeny. Metamorphism 
reached  lower  greenschist  facies  as  indicated  by  the  chlorite-biotite-cordierite-calcite-dolomite  mineral 
assemblages. The Sadiola deposit is hosted by the Kofi Formation which is currently undated. The Kofi 
Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates. || Disseminated  sulphides  gold  mineralisation  described  by  Béziat  et  al  (2008)  are  interpreted  to  be 
equivalent  to  the  sulphide-ore  type  of  Ashanti  and  Chirano  deposits  in  Ghana  and  Yaouré-Angovia 
deposits in Cote d’Ivoire. The Loulo goldfield, SSE of Sadiola, is characterised by gold mineralisation 
which is hosted in the Kofi Formation in tourmaline-rich quartz veins (Wilson, 2002). The Loulo deposit 
is associated with earlier extensional veins and occurs mainly in the Lower Birimian sequence (Fouillac et 
al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). In Ghana, gold mineralisation occurs in conglomerate beds in the Tarkwa 
District (Milési et al., 1992). Gold occurs also in five parallel NE-trending greenstone belts in Ghana. 32 || The Sadiola Fracture Zone is interpreted to be a 
splay  of  the  Senegalo-Malian  Shear  Zone. Carbonate  units  are  the  main  host  to  the  Sadiola  deposit

goldfield  were  defined  by  Matabane  (2008)  in  the  FE3  open  casts,  but  occur  throughout  the  Sadiola

silicate, followed by the calcitic marble and pelite, which is locally dolomitised.",Kofi Formation,llm

fluids and metamorphism associated with the intrusions (Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007b). Determining the 
paragenesis,  investigation  of  the  mineralogical,  microstructural  and  alteration  events  will  assist  in

350o/51oW. The  spread  of  the  data  around  the  primitive  circles  is  related  to  folding  about  a  NNW-
trending  fold  axes  (F1)  and  refolding  of  F1  about  the  ENE-ESE  trending  fold  axes  (F2). Bedding  is 
rotated against minor faults (Fig. 6). || Abstract 
Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold

The two deformation phases that are identified in the study areas of the Sadiola goldfield correlate with

Tshibubudze  et  al.,  (2009)  in  the  Markoye  Shear  Zone  in  Burkina  Faso. The  first  deformation  is 
characterized  by  the  development  of  NNW-trending  folds  (F1). NNW  bedding  and  cleavage  (S1) 
orientation associated with D1 are recorded in the study area. This deformation is termed the Tangaean 
Event and formed during the NE-SW shortening period. Quartz veins formed during this event and their 
dominant trend is towards NNE-NE. The second deformation event is characterized by the development of ENE-ESE trending folds (F2) and 
NE-trending  cleavage  (S2). || 5.4 Comparison to Sadiola goldfield with the rest of the West African Gold deposits 
The Sadiola deposits share some similarities with the other gold deposits in the West African Craton. In 
the nearby FE3 open cast, two styles of gold mineralisation were recorded by Matabane (2008). These are 
gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies which co-exists with arsenopyrite-
pyrite  assemblage  and  the  secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation. Similar  occurrence  of  orogenic  gold 
systems are recorded in Ghana, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire (Goldfarb et al., 2001). Primary gold deposits in Burkina Faso are classified as orogenic-type gold deposits (Béziat et al., 2008) 
with  the  differences  from  the  Sadiola  documented  in  the  style  of  gold  mineralisation. Two  styles  of 
mineralisation  observed  in  Burkina  Faso  are  quartz-vein  and  disseminated  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008). || CHAPTER 1: Introduction 
1.1  Preamble 
The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3 
and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société 
d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit 
(Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001). || Late-orogenic  deposits  are 
characterised by disseminated gold-bearing arsenopyrite and Au-quartz lode and quartz-vein type. These 
are interpreted as the major type and host of gold in West Africa (Milési et al., 1991).Two metallogenic 
styles  have  been  observed  in  the  Sadiola  goldfield  by  Hein  and  Tshibubudze  (2007a,  b)  and  these  are 
placer gold in the palaeochannels and screes and gold occurring in stockwork veins and breccias. 15 || Liégeois  et  al. (1991) concluded  that  metamorphism was  syn-tectonic  based  on the orientation  of  sheet 
silicates  and  amphiboles. The  KKI  sediments  were  then  intruded  by  various  granitiod  plutons  which 
caused further metamorphism (Dioh et al., 2006). The four types of granitoids that intruded the sediments 
of  the  KKI  are  sodic  calc-alkaline  granitoids,  amphibole  bearing  granitoids,  pyroxene  and  K-bearing 
granitoids  and  the  peraluminous  biotite  bearing  units  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). In  the  Sadiola  goldfield,  two 
metamorphic  events  are  recorded:  regional  metamorphism 
to  greenschist  facies  and  contact 
metamorphism  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). Contact  metamorphism  is  defined  as  the 
metamorphism that  occurs  in  close proximity  to  intrusions  and has  formed  as a  result  of  heat  from  the 
intrusion (Blatt et al., 2006). || The Sadiola Fracture Zone is interpreted to be a

also  responsible  for  the  deposition  of  calcite  and  sulphide  (mainly  pyrite)  in  the  open  spaces. The

greywacke,  alternating  greywacke-shale  units,  impure  carbonates  which  were  folded  and  contain 
limestone beds, siltstone, minor tuff and volcanoclastics units (Boshoff et al, 1998; Hanssen et al., 1998; 
Hein and Tshibubudze, 2007a, b). Jordaan et al. (1994) indicated that calcitic marbles occur in the Kofi 
Formation. The Sadiola goldfield consists of greywacke, siltstone, marble, carbonaceous to volcanoclastic 
greywacke  and  BIF  shale  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a,  b). The  goldfield  occurs  along  a  marble-
greywacke contact located east of the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (Hanssen et al., 1998). The greywacke units of the Sadiola goldfield are best developed to the west of the Sadiola Fracture Zone, 
while impure carbonates are best developed to the east. || The Dalema-Kofi Supergroup is crosscut by tourmaline-rich quartz veins which are the primary host to

Recent studies on the Sadiola open cast have indicated different metallogenic styles for the Sadiola gold

Kedougou-Kêniêba  Inlier  of  the  West  African  Craton. The  Inlier  consists  of  Birimian  metasediments

Formation is made up of Birimian-type sediments and they include greywacke, shale and graphitic shale 
with conglomeratic interbeds, banded iron formations and carbonates. || CHAPTER 1: Introduction 
1.1  Preamble 
The giant  Sadiola opencast gold mine is located  within  the Sadiola  goldfield in Mali  in the Kedougou-
Kéniéba Inlier (KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC). The goldfield also hosts the FE3 
and  the  FE4  open  casts. These  together  with  the  Sadiola  opencast  mine  are  mined  by  Société 
d’Exploitation  des  Mines  d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A  (SEMOS),  which  is  a  joint  venture  between  the 
government  of  Mali,  IAMGOLD,  IFC  and  AngloGold  Ashanti. Mining  in  the  Sadiola  opencast 
commenced in 1996 and the opencast is currently reviewing its resources and reserves. This research project concentrates primarily on the ore genesis of the Sadiola gold mine. Various deposit 
styles  have  been  suggested  for  the  Sadiola  deposit  in  the  sub-classes  of  an  orogenic  type  deposit 
(Goldfarb  et  al.,  2001). || CHAPTER 3: Regional Geology

1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The

Three  types  of  gold  mineralisation  have  been  recognised  in  the  West  African  Craton. These  are  pre-
orogenic,  syn-orogenic  and  late-orogenic  mineralisation. Mineralisation  is  related  to  regional  tectonic 
event (Milesi et al, 1992; Beziat et al., 2008). Pre-orogenic deposits are associated with early extensional 
zones and are recorded in stratiform Au tourmalinite in the Loulo goldfield in Mali (Milési et al., 1991; 
Fouillac et al., 1993; Béziat et al., 2008). Syn-orogenic mineralisation is associated with mineralisation in 
disseminated  sulphides  in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rock  (Milési  et  al.,  1992).",West African Craton,llm

3.1 The geology of the West African Craton and the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier 
The West African Craton (Fig. 2) is a piece of continental crust that has been stable since approximately 
1.7Ga (Dia et al., 1997). It is divided into the Man shield in the south and the Reguibat shield in the north. The  two  shields  are  separated  by  the  upper  Proterozoic  to  Paleozoic  sedimentary  Taoudeni  basin. The 
Reguibat Rise and the Man terrains are composed of Archaean to Proterozoic rock formations (Potrel et 
al., 1998) with the Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Man shield referred to as the Birimian sequence (Beziat 
et al., 2000). The Kêniêba and Kayes inliers are situated towards the western border of Senegal and Mali (Fig.",western border of Senegal and Mali,llm

WAC crops out in western Mali in what is known as the Kedougou-Kêniêba Inlier (Dia et al., 1997). The 
Birimian sequence represents a large sedimentary basin and a volcanic belt which correlates well with the

Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) in the West African Craton can be divided into three distinct domains: 
the  eastern,  central  and  the  western  domain  (Matabane  and  Hein,  submitted). The  central  and  eastern 
domains are separated by the Senegalo-Malian Shear Zone (SMF) while the central and western domains 
are separated by the Main Transcurrent Shear Zone (MTZ) (Fig. 3). The  geology  of  these  domains  is  defined  largely  by  Boshoff  et  al. (1989),  Ledru  et al.",western domain,llm
