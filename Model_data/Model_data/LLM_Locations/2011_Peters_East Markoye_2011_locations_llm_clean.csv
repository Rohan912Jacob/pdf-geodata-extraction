sedimentary facies. It is still being in-filled today with sediment from an active volcanic arc 
(Carter and Naish.,  1998). Thick sequences of  greywacke and thin conglomerate beds from

the uplifted regions, towards the basin. The sediment was then deposited in a deltaic system. The  greywackes  were  deposited  in  this  deltaic  system  on  a  steep  submarine  slope  which 
allowed for rapid deposition, gravity sliding and slumping, synonymous with turbiditic flows. The erosion rate of the arc is interpreted as getting progressively slower throughout the filling

2.1. Preamble 
The  study  area  is  situated  in  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  in  north-east 
Burkina  Faso  (Fig. 1). Besides  the  research  completed  by  Tshibubudze  et  al. (2009)  which 
only encompassed a minor portion to the north of the study area, the study area has not been 
previously  mapped  or  described. || Abstract 
The  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gourouol  Greenstone  Belt  (OGGB)  are  largely  made  up  of 
supracrustal,  island-arc  derived  sediments  including,  but  not  limited  to,  thick  greywacke 
sequences. These were deposited in a deltaic-shelf environment on the margin of a back-arc 
basin. The  local  stratigraphy  has  been  constrained  by  facies  variation  determined  by 
sedimentary  features  and  differences  in  the  depositional  environment. Regional  low-middle 
greenschist  metamorphism  is  shown  by  the  ubiquitous  presence  of  chlorite,  epidote  and 
minor  muscovite  and  is  suggested  to  be  a  result  of  large  TTG  pluton  emplacement  that 
occurred  syn-tectonically  with  the  Eburnean  Orogeny. This  thesis  proposes  it  is  due  to 
diastathermal  metamorphism  caused  by  back-arc  extension  and  mantle  upwelling. Contact 
metamorphism of the greywacke to hornblende-hornfels facies occurs within close proximity 
of  the  calc-alkaline  dykes.",Oudalan-Gourouol Greenstone Belt,llm

The  WAC,  namely  the  Birimian  Supergroup,  consists  of  many  island  arc  terranes  that 
underwent terrane accretion (2300-2250 Ma). This occurred during the process of subduction, 
thus  creating  a  felsic  continental  crust  due  to  its  association  with  TTG,  calc-alkaline 
plutonism (Klein and Moura., 2009). Following this, other cratonic blocks  which formed in 
the  same  way,  collided  with  the  accreted  arcs  to  form  orogenic  belts  and  the  closure  of  an 
oceanic basin. The Eburnean Orogeny is an example of this process (Hirdes et al., 1996; Hein 
et al., 2004; Feybesse et al., 2006). The OGGB is one of the island arc terranes, and the east

The study area is situated approximately 2 km east of the town of Markoye and is located 12 
km west of the international border of Niger and 38 km south of the border of Mali (Fig. 2). The town of Markoye is located at the divide between the Sahel and the Sahara; everything 
north of the town is considered to be the Sahara Desert. Thus, the field area is an arid and hot 
environment with much of the surface covered with sand and loose gravels making outcrop 
difficult to find in the low-lying areas. The areas of high relief however, are desert mountains 
that contain a large amount of rock which, unfortunately, was dominated by  loose boulders 
and very little in situ-outcrop. || 5.0. Lithologies 
The geology of the study area consists of metamorphosed and folded sedimentary sequences 
as well as igneous intrusions. The geology is best expressed on ridges to the east and south-
east of the town of Markoye. In-situ outcrop is difficult to locate because approximately 95 % 
of the exposed rock mass is made up of dislodged boulders and blocks (Figs. 6 a & b). This 
made  retrieving  accurate  measurements  difficult.",town of Markoye,llm
