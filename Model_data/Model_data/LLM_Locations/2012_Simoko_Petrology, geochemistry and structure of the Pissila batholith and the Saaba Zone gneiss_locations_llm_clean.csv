predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation 
event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism. || The  Pissila  batholith  and  the  Saaba  zone  exhibit  some  similarities  to  granitoid-gneissic

under  processes  similar  to  those  that  formed  granitoid-gneisses  in  the  above  countries. Therefore, the Saaba zone was possibly intruded by the Pissila batholith. The intrusion leads 
to partial melting and migmatization of the gneisses. Analysis of microstructures in the Pissila batholith and the Saaba zone gneiss suggests the 
rocks were subjected to two deformation events. The Saaba zone gneiss and migmatites was 
deformed to amphibolites facies during D1 deformation event.",Senegal,llm

The Bauolé-Mossi domain consists of predominately Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline and 
alkaline granitoid intrusions. Theses rocks were emplaced between ca 2.1 to 1.8 Ga (Vega et 
al.,  2008). The  presence  of  terranes  that  predates  and  may  act  as  basement  rocks  to  the 
Birimian granitoids has been the subject of debate. Basement rocks are typically gneissic to 
migmatitic,  thus  the  granitoid-gneissic  terranes  in  the  West  African  Craton  became  the 
subject of a number of studies (Eisenhohr and Hirdes, 1992, Pons et al., 1995, Hirdes et al., 
1996,  Gasquet  et  al.,  2003). Lemoine,  1988  in  Gasquet  et  al.,  2003  introduced  the  term 
Burkinian,  which  corresponds  to  reworking  of  Archean  rocks  and  formed  the  gneissic

The  Pissila  batholith  is  a  foliated  coarse-grained  granodiorite,  which  is  located  in  north 
eastern Burkina Faso. The batholith was emplaced at 2143 ±12 Ma and 2117 ±17Ma, coeval 
with  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  Eburnean  orogeny  represents  a  period  of  major  crustal 
growth in an island arc setting. The batholith is geochemically similar to other calc-alkaline 
granitoids in the domain. The Saaba zone gneiss, which is locally migmatitic is located within 
the  Pissila  batholith. Geochemically,  the  gneiss  and  migmatites  have  some  Archean  TTG 
affiliations. || Granitoids  that  are  associated  with  gneisses  and  migmatites  were  previously 
described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded 
that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the 
Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each 
other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may 
predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation
