Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in

1.5. Thesis Organisation 
This thesis is organisation into eight chapters including the Introduction as follows:- 
(1) Chapter Two provides a review of the geology  of West Africa, volcanology and volcanic-related 
ore deposits. Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis.",Washington,GPE,spacy
2013_Peters.txt,21,"1.6. Limitations of the study 
A major limitation to this study  was the inability to continue fieldwork as a result of political 
instability and war in the neighbouring country of Mali from February to April 2013; foreigners were 
restricted  from  access  to  Burkina  Faso  north  of  the  13  Parallel  (Figure  1.1),  or  advised  against 
unnecessary  travel. The  result  was  a  smaller  sample  suite  and  smaller  mapping  area. However,  a 
comparative geochemical study was undertaken using data for volcanic samples from various volcano-
sedimentary belts in Burkina Faso as an expanded study. 21",Mali,GPE,spacy

2.1. Stratigraphy 
The West African Craton (WAC) is made up of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks and is 
divided  into  the  Reguibat  Rise  in  the  north  and  the  Leo-Man  Rise  in  the  south  (Thiéblemont  et  al., 
2004)  (Figure  1.1). The  Leo-Man  consists  of  two  domains,  namely  the  Archaean  Kénema-Man 
domain  (3.54  Ga)  in  the  southwest  and the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (2.3-1.8  Ga)  in 
the  east  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006),  with  the  exception  of  the  Kénieba-  Kédougou  and  Kayes  Inliers, 
located  between  Mali  and  Senegal  (Figure  1.1). The  Birimian  Supergroup  makes  up  part  of  the 
Baoulé-Mossi  domain  and  was  deposited  ca. 2.3  Ga  (Feybesse  et  al.,  2006;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).",Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic,LOC,spacy

craton-wide studies by WAXI (2013) indicated that the stratigraphic order of volcanic rocks cannot be 
generalised  (some  belts  do  not  host  tholeiitic  and/or  calc-alkaline  volcanic  rocks)  and  thus  the 
stratigraphy of each greenstone belt must be established independently. 2.2. Granitoid and dolerite emplacement 
The emplacement of tonalite-trondjemite-granodiorite (TTG) plutons and granites in the WAC 
is restricted to 2200, 2160-2130 and 2100-2070 Ma according to Pawlig et al. (2006) and Gueye et al. (2008).",Pawlig,GPE,spacy

way  to  undertake  mapping,  reconnaissance  work,  identifying  possible  sample  location  sites  and 
possible  traverse  lines. Geological  mapping  focused  on  contacts,  structures,  facies  delineation  and 
volcanic  textures. The  purpose  was  to  create  geological  and  facies  maps  (Figure  3.1  and  3.2)  with

GB (e.g., hyaloclastites, jointing and volcanic glass). For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well 
preserved volcanic textures where the rocks are not strongly altered by hydrothermal processes and/or

Volcano-sedimentary  belts  make  up  a  large  part  of  the  stratigraphy  of  the  Palaeoproterozoic 
Baoulé-Mossi domain (West Africa) in northeast Burkina Faso (Figure 1.1). The belts are composed 
of  dominantly  lower  to  middle  greenschist  metamorphosed  volcanic,  pyroclastic  and  sedimentary 
rocks  with  extensive  units  of  basalt-andesite,  dacite  and  less  substantial  amounts  of  pyroclastite 
(Milési et al., 1989, 1991; Leube et al., 1990; Ledru et al., 1991). Carbonaceous and Mn-Fe bearing 
chemical sedimentary units are intercalated with the volcanic rocks (Blanchot et al., 1972; Béssoles, 
1977; Wright, 1985; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008). The volcanic sequences of the Baoulé-Mossi domain were first described in the Birim Valley in

of the greywackes in the southern GB took place proximal to the source. Consequently, the greywacke

banding has been recorded in the Archaean Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa (Robbins et al.,

Effusive eruptions are typical of basaltic liquids, particularly when submerged beneath the confining

than explode (Parfitt and Wilson, 2008) because volatiles escape passively through vesicle formation 
(McPhie et al., 1993; Bardintzeff and McBirney, 2000; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). The  coherent  and  autoclastic  facies  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  proximally  to  the  volcanic
