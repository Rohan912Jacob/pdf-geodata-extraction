African  craton,  and  extends  into  the  neighbouring  Niger. The  greenstone  belt  is  characterised  by 
meta-volcanic  and  meta-sedimentary  rocks,  and  intruded  by  various  igneous  rocks  (Tshibubudze  et 
al., 2009). It hosts various Au deposits, notably the Essakane goldfield, but smaller artisanal sites can

2.1 Regional Geology 
The West African craton (WAC) is ~ 4.5 million km2 and comprises two shields, the Reguibat Rise in 
the north and the Leo-Man Rise to the south (Milési et al., 1992; Villeneuve and Cornée, 1994; Attoh 
and Ekwueme, 1997; Potrel et al., 1998). The Taoudeni basin, situated in the central part of the craton, 
separates the two shields and is Neo-Proterozoic to Devonian in age (Dioh et al., 2006). The Leo-Man 
Rise  in  the  south  comprises  two  domains:  the  Archaean  Kenéma-Man  domain  and  the 
Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain. The  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  is  host  to  Birimian  sequences, 
and these include meta-sedimentary and meta-volcanic rocks (Milési et al., 1991; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 
1993). Based on previous interpretations by Milési et al. (1991), Debat et al.",Attoh,GPE,spacy

emplacement  of  igneous  bodies  (Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). The  environment  of  deposition  is 
interpreted to be a shallow marine continental shelf (Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The  supracrustal  rocks  of  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  greenstone  belt  have  experienced  two  deformation 
events  that  resulted  in  the  formation  of  shears,  folds,  mylonite  zones  and  regional  metamorphism;

2.1 Regional Geology 
The West African craton (WAC) is ~ 4.5 million km2 and comprises two shields, the Reguibat Rise in 
the north and the Leo-Man Rise to the south (Milési et al., 1992; Villeneuve and Cornée, 1994; Attoh 
and Ekwueme, 1997; Potrel et al., 1998). The Taoudeni basin, situated in the central part of the craton, 
separates the two shields and is Neo-Proterozoic to Devonian in age (Dioh et al., 2006). The Leo-Man 
Rise  in  the  south  comprises  two  domains:  the  Archaean  Kenéma-Man  domain  and  the 
Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain. The  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  is  host  to  Birimian  sequences, 
and these include meta-sedimentary and meta-volcanic rocks (Milési et al., 1991; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 
1993). Based on previous interpretations by Milési et al. (1991), Debat et al.",Regional Geology The West African craton,regex-GEO,regex

volcanic belts that  correspond to the period of accretion during the Eburnean orogeny. The north-eastern Burkina Faso consists of the Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic 
Birimian sequences (2184–2135 Ma) (Davis et al., 1994). The sequences are divided into the upper 
and lower Birimian. These are unconformably overlain by the Tarkwa Group (2194-2132 Ma), first 
described  in  the  Birim  River  in  Ghana  and  are  believed  to  be  derivatives  of  the  upper  Birimian
