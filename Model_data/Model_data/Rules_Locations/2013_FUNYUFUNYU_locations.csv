Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) has been a crucial industry in Africa for centuries. In 
Burkina  Faso  approximately  95  kms  northeast  of  the  capital  city  Ouagadougou  near  the  village  of 
Dem  and  on  a  ferricrete  capped  ridge  to  the  west  of  the  village,  it  is  possible  to  find  a  number  of 
opencast workings and underground mines that show evidence of extensive artisanal mining for iron. Iron mining worked quartz-vein hosted and lateritic ore. Nearby, waste piles, processing sites and at 
least  eleven  (11)  Bloomery  furnaces  are  exposed  on  the  alluvial  plain. Petrographically  the  ore 
bearing  rocks  consist  of  goethite-hematite  as  the  dominant  oxides  with  silica. Geological  and 
ethnographic  studies  conducted  in  2011  focussed  on  detailing  and  mapping  the  mine  site  and  host 
rocks  (including  ore  rocks),  and  establishing  the  age  of  mining,  processing  and  forging  of  ore.",Africa,LOC,spacy

Artisanal  and  Small-scale  Mining  is  the  oldest  form  of  mining  known  in  Africa  and  Europe 
(c.f., Agricola, 1556). To date, there is no internationally acceptable definition of Artisanal and Small-
scale  Mining  (ASM). The United  Nations  uses the  volume  of  material  mined  as  a  base  criterion  to 
establish the difference between small and large-scale mining (ICMM, 2010), but summarily, artisanal 
mining  involves  mining  activities  conducted  on  ore  bodies  or  deposits  by  persons  using  traditional 
techniques  and/or  low  mechanisation  levels  (Anonymous,  1999)  using  extraction  and  processing  of 
minerals by intensive selective manual labour. ASM mostly occurs in rural areas by artisanal miners

In West Africa, the volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Birimian Supergroup contain iron (Milési 
et al., 1989; Bamba et al., 2002). These rocks are often overlain by an extensive lateritic weathering 
profile  that  provide  laterite  mantles  and  screes  to  younger  ferricrust  (Beauvais  and  Chardon,  2013; 
WAXI, 2013). Lateritization processes regulate the weathering products through extreme leaching of 
the silica and alkaline-earth elements of the bed rock, which results in a mineralogical reorganization 
of iron oxide, silica and alumina (Nahon 1991; Tardy 1993).",Schuhmann,GPE,spacy
2013_FUNYUFUNYU.txt,27,"According to Pryce et al. (2010), laterites 
result from the decomposition of rock within a dynamic leaching environment. Beauvais  et  al. (2008)  stated  that  most  laterite  deposits  in  the  northeast  Burkina  Faso  were 
formed  by  long-term  meteoric  weathering. Formation  probably  took  place  in  a  tectonically  stable, 
slowly  eroding,  tropical  environment  (Brown  et  al.,  1994;  10Be  and26Al  isotopic  depletion  ratios  of 
ferricrete)  in  the  Cretaceous  period  and  during  breakup  of  Gondwanaland,  with  reworking  of  the 
laterite  during  the  Miocene-Eocene  (Beauvais  et  al.,  2008;  Beauvais  and  Chardon,  2013;  WAXI, 
2013). Although Burkina Faso is currently in a sub-tropical to Sahelian climatic zone, geographically 
it was positioned in a tropical climatic zone during the Cretaceous when the equator was located just

2013_FUNYUFUNYU.txt,28,"However, 
laterites derived from weathering of basic or ultra-basic rocks, or host rocks that are enriched in iron, 
such as iron-rich shales and siltstones, may be sufficiently rich in iron (and/or other elements such as 
nickel) to be minable. This is the case in the Dem study area, where iron-rich laterite overlies iron-rich 
shale host rocks of the Birimian Supergroup. In  contrast  to  laterite,  ferricrete  is  the  iron-cemented  duricrust  that  is  formed  by  various 
processes  particularly  pedogenesis  (McFarlane,  1976). Generally  it  overlies  the  laterite  profile  in 
Burkina  Faso  but  is  still  regarded  as  part  of  the  laterite  weathering  profile  (Schwartz,  1994). The 
mineralogy of ferricrete is typically composed of goethite, limonite, lepicrocite, hematite in varying 
proportions,  sometimes  with  minor  amounts  of  manganese  oxides,  and  residual  base  metal  sulfides 
(Craig  and  Vaughan,  1994). The  profile  typically  presents  indurated  strata  rich  in  kaolinite  and

of iron working in West Africa; a fuller investigation of the Dem site is thus needed. Certainly, there is currently little evidence of iron smelting for the period 1430 to 1480 AD for

In West Africa, the volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Birimian Supergroup contain iron (Milési 
et al., 1989; Bamba et al., 2002). These rocks are often overlain by an extensive lateritic weathering 
profile  that  provide  laterite  mantles  and  screes  to  younger  ferricrust  (Beauvais  and  Chardon,  2013; 
WAXI, 2013). Lateritization processes regulate the weathering products through extreme leaching of 
the silica and alkaline-earth elements of the bed rock, which results in a mineralogical reorganization 
of iron oxide, silica and alumina (Nahon 1991; Tardy 1993).",Beauvais,GEO,geotext

composition that is characterised by SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, H2O and accessory elements, including Cr, 
V,  Zr  and  Ti. However,  laterites  exhibit  a  vertical  zonality  of  their  characteristics  and  components 
(Blot,  2004)  but  are  typically  a  weathering  profile  consisting  of  some,  or  all  of  the  soil  profile, 
ferruginous  crust  and  bedrock. Laterites  in  the  northeast  of  Burkina  Faso  are  similar  but  some  are 
developed from weathering of tuffaceous schist and calc-alkaline granites (Brown et al., 1994). In general, iron laterites are low in iron and not of economic interest (Read, 1937).",Taylor,GEO,geotext

samples younger than 55 000 years. According to Anderson et al. (1950), the radiocarbon method is

isotope rapidly oxidizes to form CO2, which is absorbed by all living organisms through the process 
of photosynthesis. Subsequent to death and burial of an organism, the material loses 14C as it converts 
to 14N by radioactive decay. Based on the studies by Taylor (1987) and Libby (1952), the method used in radiocarbon dating 
is  the  Libby-half  life  (t½)  of  5570  ±  30  years  and  assumes  that  (1)  the  14C  production  in  the 
atmosphere has been constant through time, (2) the concentration of  14C is homogeneous for all parts

4.1. Introduction 
The  mining  of  iron  ore  in  the  Dem  study  area  produced  a  limited  number  of  underground 
workings and surface open pits. These mine workings show no modern mechanised mining method of 
operating. The  surveyed  ASM  site  covers  1.9  km  by  1.3  km. About  four  ore  extraction  areas  and 
eleven  smelting  sites  were  located  during  field  studies  but  a  broader  study  of  the  Dem  region  is

temperature  (1200°C)  slag  (Craddock  and  Meeks,  1987). The  magnetite-hematite  rich  veins  were 
structurally controlled in the host rocks. Lateritic ore also provided a second source of iron-rich rock 
for mining at the Dem site. Processing  sites  comprised  at  least  11  furnaces  that  were  dome  and  circular  in  shape. The
