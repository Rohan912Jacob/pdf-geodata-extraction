The  Pissila  batholith  is  a  foliated  coarse-grained  granodiorite,  which  is  located  in  north 
eastern Burkina Faso. The batholith was emplaced at 2143 ±12 Ma and 2117 ±17Ma, coeval 
with  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  Eburnean  orogeny  represents  a  period  of  major  crustal 
growth in an island arc setting. The batholith is geochemically similar to other calc-alkaline 
granitoids in the domain. The Saaba zone gneiss, which is locally migmatitic is located within 
the  Pissila  batholith. Geochemically,  the  gneiss  and  migmatites  have  some  Archean  TTG 
affiliations.",Saaba,GPE,spacy

described in north eastern Burkina Faso, Côte d’lvoire and Senegal. These studies concluded 
that the granitoids intruded into the pre-existing gneissic terrane. This study suggests that the 
Saaba  zone  and  Pissila  batholith  are  geochemically  and  petrological  different  from  each 
other. The Saaba zone gneiss does not  represent  a deformed region  of the Pissila batholith. Based on similarities of the study area to other granitoid-gneissic terrane, the Saaba zone may 
predate the Pissila batholith. It is also proposed that the gneiss preserve an older deformation 
event  D1,  which  lead  to  amphibolite  facies  metamorphism.",Senegal,GPE,spacy

The Bauolé-Mossi domain consists of predominately Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline and

migmatitic,  thus  the  granitoid-gneissic  terranes  in  the  West  African  Craton  became  the 
subject of a number of studies (Eisenhohr and Hirdes, 1992, Pons et al., 1995, Hirdes et al.,
