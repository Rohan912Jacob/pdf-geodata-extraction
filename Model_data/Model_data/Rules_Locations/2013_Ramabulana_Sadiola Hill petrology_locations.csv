The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which 
is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises 
meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and 
marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two 
facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite 
and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part 
of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta-
sedimentary rocks.",Western Mali,LOC,spacy
2013_Ramabulana_Sadiola Hill petrology.txt,5,"Two main veins occur in the Sadiola deposit: (1) quartz-carbonate veins and (2) quartz-sulphide veins. The quartz-sulphide veins crosscut the quartz-carbonate veins forming an array of stockwork and 
spider veins. The host rocks contain a pervasive alteration assemblage (quartz-chlorite-carbonate-k-
spar-sulphide) with a more pervasive sericite alteration which encloses veins and is associated with 
mineralisation. Supergene processes decomposes pyrite to marcasite after vein formation. Mineralisation in the deposit occurs within and/or adjacent to quartz-carbonate and quartz sulphide 
veins. Two styles of mineralisation are present; (1) quartz-vein mineralisation were gold is 
concentrated in margins of pyrite and arsenopyrite, and in fractures and (2) a disseminated style were 
gold occurs as discrete grains in alteration zones.",Sadiola,GPE,spacy

of models was a consequence of the relative absence of fresh sulphide mineralisation for study

the intrusion-related model proposed by Theron (1997) and Hein and Tshibubudze (2007a,b; 2008)

2.1.1 Geology of the West African Craton 
The West African Craton (WAC) is composed of an Achaean and Palaeoproterozoic basement that is 
divided into two shields which are the Reguibat shield in the north and the Man shield in south (Potrel 
et al., 1998). These two shields are separated by the Taoudeni basin, which is Neoproterozoic to 
Devonian in age and are entirely surrounded by Pan African and Hercynian belts (Matthias et al. 2002). The Reguibat shield contains Palaeoproterozoic assemblages in the eastern part as well as 
Archean relicts which include kimberlites (Ennih and Liegeois, 2008). Large parts of the WAC in the 
Man Shield consist of Palaeoproterozoic rocks referred to as the Birimian Supergroup (Abouchami et

The Sadiola Hill deposit in Western Mali is located within the Kedougou-Kéniéba Inlier (KKI) which 
is part of the West African Craton. The deposit is situated within the Sadiola goldfield and comprises 
meta-sedimentary rocks and volcanic intrusions. The meta-sedimentary rocks are meta-greywacke and 
marble which have been metamorphosed to hornblende-hornfels and epidote-chlorite facies. The two 
facies are characteristic of contact metamorphism. The volcanic intrusions are tonalite-granodiorite 
and quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes which cross-cut the meta-sedimentary rocks. The dykes are part 
of the Sekokoto pluton (2083 ± 7 Ma) and are responsible for contact metamorphism in the meta-
sedimentary rocks.",West African Craton,regex-GEO,regex

The Sadiola Hill gold mine is located within the Sadiola goldfield in the Kedougou-Kenieba inlier 
(KKI), which is part of the West African Craton (WAC) and is situated in western Mali. The Sadiola 
goldfield is located close to the Alamoutala-Sekokoto-Kakadian plutonic system and mineralisation 
has been shown to have a relationship with the tonalite-granodiorite plutons and diorite dykes. The 
goldfield also hosts the FE3, FE4, Timbabougouni mines, and FE2 and Tambali prospects. The 
relative association of mineralisation with highly deformed and metamorphosed rocks of the Birimian 
Supergroup makes it difficult to derive an ore genetic model. The model is important for regional and 
in-mine exploration, but also significant for understanding geologic evolution of the host rocks. A number of different ore genesis models have been proposed for Sadiola Hill deposit.",Sadiola goldfield,regex-GEO,regex
2013_Ramabulana_Sadiola Hill petrology.txt,7,"The main focus of this project has therefore been to derive an ore genesis model for the Sadiola Hill 
gold deposit by contrasting the intrusion related style hypothesis proposed for the deposit by Theron 
(1997) with the shear-hosted style hypothesis proposed by Hanssen et al. (1998) using petrographic 
analysis. The features which will characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit (i.e. indicator minerals, 
alteration assemblage and mineral textures) will be used to contrast the two models and to establish a 
likely model for the deposit. 1.2 Location and Physiography 
The Sadiola Hill gold mine is situated in the Sadiola goldfield, in western Mali at about 77km south of 
the regional capital, Kayes, near the international border of Mali with Senegal (Fig.1). Mali is a 
landlocked country bordered by Niger to the east, Burkina Faso to the east, Algeria to the north, and 
Senegal and Mauritania to the west in the West African Savannah-Sahel region

1.3. Aims and Objectives 
The main aim of this research project is to derive an ore genetic model that characterizes the potential 
source of gold mineralization and the style of deposition at the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, by 
petrographical investigation of the host rocks and associated sulphides. Microscopic analyses will be 
used to identify any characteristic indicator minerals which characterise the Sadiola Hill gold deposit, 
alteration and sulphide assemblages. A detailed study of mineralogy, alteration assemblage and 
microstructures will be of importance in contrasting the intrusion-related style with the shear-hosted 
style hypotheses with which the difference will be used to establish the most likely model for the
