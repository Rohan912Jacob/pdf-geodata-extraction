2.1 Stratigraphy 
The  lithostratigraphy  in  north-eastern  Burkina  Faso  is  defined  by  NE-trending  Birimian  meta-
volcaniclastic  greywacke  and  intercalated  meta-conglomerate,  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  1. 2). The 
Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower 
Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in 
origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated 
black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et 
al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists 
of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al., 
1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian 
sequences  were  metamorphosed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  and  were  intruded  by  numerous  calc-
alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are 
collectively  termed  the  Eburnean  granitoids  (Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Naba  et  al.,  2004;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).",Naba,GPE,spacy

1.1 Preamble 
Most geological maps of Burkina Faso are outdated and due to high cost of aerial photography the maps 
have not been updated. There is massive investment in exploration in NE Burkina Faso and there are few 
geological maps that assist in targeting, with the latest being completed by Castaing in 2003. Therefore a 
GIS  interpretation  was  undertaken  to  create  a  strato-tectonic-magmatic  map  for  the  area. GIS 
interpretation has become the most important modern tool for geological interpretation and a fundamental 
approach in grassroots exploration for the delineation of resource potential. It involves the breaking up of 
complex  data  planes  into  simpler  and  more  interpretable  forms  related  to  geological  features. Remote 
sensing analysis from GIS is used to extract drainage and topographic patterns, curvilinear features and 
stands of lithologically related vegetation (Drury, 1987).",Most,GEO,geotext

was used to support this work. This consisted of a 1990 topographic map of scale 1:500 000, 1990 land

2.1 Stratigraphy 
The  lithostratigraphy  in  north-eastern  Burkina  Faso  is  defined  by  NE-trending  Birimian  meta-
volcaniclastic  greywacke  and  intercalated  meta-conglomerate,  siltstone  and  shale  (Figure  1. 2). The 
Birimian stratigraphy was divided into two parts by Junner (1935; 1940) in (Leube et al., 1990), the lower 
Birimian series and the upper Birimian series. The lower Birimian series is predominantly sedimentary in 
origin  and  includes  dacitic/rhyodacitic  meta-volcaniclastic  sediments,  meta-greywacke  with intercalated 
black meta-siltstone and manganiferous chert, argillite, shale and chemical meta-sedimentary (Feybesse et 
al., 1990; Leube et al., 1990; Hirdes et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1991). The upper Birimian series consists 
of metamorphosed basic and intermediate lavas and pyroclastic rocks (Feybesse et al., 1990; Leube et al., 
1990; Hirdes et al., 1996; Milési et al., 1991, 1992; Naba, 2004; Tshibubudze et al., 2009). The Birimian 
sequences  were  metamorphosed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  and  were  intruded  by  numerous  calc-
alkaline  plutons  including  tonalite  (TTG),  granodiorite,  diorite  and  meta-diorite  bodies  that  are 
collectively  termed  the  Eburnean  granitoids  (Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Naba  et  al.,  2004;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).",Eburnean Orogeny,regex-GEO,regex
2010_Mohale_GIS interpretation of NE Burkina Faso.txt,15,"Lateritic profiles cover much of the West African craton. The  Birimian  sequences  were  metamorphosed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  where  the  meta-
volcanic  and  metasedimentary  rocks  were  subjected  to  crustal  shortening  associated  with  greenschist 
facies  regional  metamorphism  (Oberthur  et  al.,  1998)  and  by  further  metamorphism  related  to  the 
intrusion  of  granitoids  (Milesi  et  al.,  1989,  1991;  Bossiére  et  al.,  1996;  Hirdes  et  al. 1996;  Hein  et  al.,

mineral  assemblage  and  abundant  hornblende  and  andalusite  mineral  assemblages  which  are  low  to 
medium grade amphibolites facies (Bossiére et al., 1996; Béziat et al., 2000; Naba et al., 2004; Pawlig et
