period of transcurrent tectonics, soon after the cessation of regional-scale contractional 
deformation  (e.g,  in  the  Ashanti  belt  of  Ghana,  Allibone  et  al.,  2002a,  b;  in  southern 
Mali,  Olson  et  al.,  1992;  McFarlane  et  al.,  2011;  in  the  KKI,  Lawrence  et  al.,  2013a; 
Treloar et al., 2014). At Morila, orogenic gold mineralization has been dated at 2074 ± 
14 Ma (McFarlane et al., 2011: U-Pb on hydrothermal titanite). The structural evolution 
from early fold-and-thrust tectonics to strike-slip tectonics has been described in other 
orogenic belts (e.g. Vassallo and Wilson, 2002; Clegg and Holdsworth, 2005; Ulrich et 
al.,  2011)  and  is  typically  associated  with  gold-forming  events. At  Sadiola  Hill,  the 
Sadiola Fracture Zone was the dominant structure active during mineralization and has 
therefore focused the greatest amount of dilation and permeability.",Holdsworth,GPE,spacy

plunge  45°S,  indicating  that  mineralization  resulted  from  the  sinistral-normal  linkage 
between the Sadiola Fracture Zone and the NNE-trending shears (Fig. 12). Within the 
KKI, NW-SE shortening in a transpressive regime has similarly been proposed for the 
Kolia-Boboti  sedimentary  basin  (Dabo  and  Aïfa,  2010;  Diene  et  al.,  2012)  and  in  a 
transtensional regime for the Loulo district (Lawrence et al., 2013a). Vein geometry and 
kinematic  indicators  associated  with  the  steep  NE-trending  barren  quartz  veins 
(240°/65°NW)  present  at  Sadiola  Hill  are  consistent  with  a  late  phase  of  NW-SE 
extension (D4s). These veins post-date mineralization. The last local deformation event 
(D5s) is associated with the formation of WNW-trending sub-vertical brittle cross-faults

movement along both the Sadiola Fracture Zone and the NNE-trending shears, synchronous with 
the  potassic  hydrothermal  alteration  stage  and  gold  mineralization. The  latest  recorded  event  is

mineralization trends. 7.2. Physico-chemical  conditions  of  the  ore-forming  fluid  and 
potential controls on Au-Sb co-precipitation 
The  principal  parameters  that  are  generally  assumed  to  control  ore  mineral 
solubility, other than the activities of the aqueous metallic species, are temperature (T), 
pressure  (P),  oxygen  fugacity  (f02),  pH  and  the  total  sulphur  activity  (Σas)  (Williams-
Jones  and  Normand,  1997). Gold  saturation  and  precipitation  at  Sadiola  Hill  is 
interpreted to have occurred predominantly in response to decompression during brittle-
ductile  failure  and  sulfidation  reactions  during  fluid  -  wall-rock  interaction. The 
extensive brecciation recorded over the best-mineralized drill core intersects illustrates 
the enhanced and cumulative dilation that has developed along the vertical and left-hand 
flexures  of  the  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone.",Normand,GPE,spacy

1979; Williams-Jones and Normand, 1997). The Au-Sb-rich stage II is characterized by 
the  formation  of  aurostibite  and  native  gold. Favorable  chemical  conditions  for 
aurostibite  formation  are  from  weakly  acidic  to  alkaline  conditions  and  a  low  sulfur

formation of the gold + aurostibite mineral assemblage is 360°C (Hansen and Anderko,

2015_Masurel_phd.txt,77,"7.3. Towards a genetic model… 
The Sadiola Hill deposit shares a number of characteristics typical of  orogenic 
gold deposits worldwide (Mikucki and Ridley, 1993; Groves et al., 1998; McCuaig and 
Kerrich, 1998; Ridley and Diamond, 2000; Bierlein and Maher, 2001; Goldfarb et al., 
2001;  Groves  et  al.,  2003;  Bierlein  et  al.,  2006)  including  a  late-orogenic  relative 
timing,  strong  regional  (i.e.,  Senegal-Mali  Shear  Zone)  and  local  structural  controls 
(i.e.,  Sadiola  Fracture  Zone  and  NNE-trending  shear  array)  on  ore  location  and 
geometry,  and  a  pronounced  Au-As-Sb  metal  enrichment  association. The  metal 
enrichment  association  and  geothermometric  estimates  from  ore  and  alteration 
paragenesis are compatible with mesozonal Au-As-Te (6-12 km, 300°-475°C) to near-
epizonal Au-Sb (≤6 km, 150°-300°C) conditions in terms of crustal level based on the 
proposed classification of orogenic gold deposits by Groves et al. (1998). However, the 
high  temperature  ore  and  alteration  paragenesis  at  Sadiola  Hill  is  in  thermal 
disequilibrium  with  host  rocks  at  regional  greenschist-facies  conditions,  which  is 
atypical  for  that  class  of  deposit. Such  geological  feature  alone  is  not  diagnostic  of  a 
magmatic fluid source because it can reflect the interaction of a fluid from any source 
with reactive country rocks at a temperature high enough to form stable actinolite and 
biotite  (Ridley  and  Diamond,  2000;  Meinert  et  al.,  2005).",Ridley,GPE,spacy
2015_Masurel_phd.txt,78,"Hill  hydrothermal  system  remains  uncertain. Indeed,  although  a  magmatic  source  is 
indicated at Massawa (Treloar et al., 2014) and may be proposed for Sadiola Hill, gold 
deposits  of  the  Kweke  district  in  the  Archean  Midlands  greenstone  belt  of  Zimbabwe 
are  associated  with  low  salinity,  mixed  aqueous-carbonic  fluid  inclusions  and  stable 
isotope  data  indicating  a  homogeneous  metamorphic  or  mixed  metamorphic  and/or 
magmatic  fluid  source  for  both  the  Au-As  and  the  Au-Sb  mineralization  stages 
(Buchholz et al., 2007). 8. Conclusions 
The  presented  field  and  mineralogical  data  suggest  that  the  Sadiola  Hill 
carbonate-hosted Au-As-Sb mineralization formed during a period of sinistral tectonics 
(i.e. D3s  NNW-SSE  shortening)  that  was  coeval  with  calc-alkaline  magmatic  activity

with a region-wide compressive event (D2) (in Ivory Coast, Pouclet et al., 2006; Vidal et

The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold 
production 
in 
the  world. The  Kédougou-Kénieba 
inlier  (KKI)  represents 
the 
westernmost  exposure  of  Paleoproterozoic  crust  in  the  West  African  Craton,  with 
outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent 
discoveries  in  the  inlier  have  triggered  a  real  need  for  understanding  the  controls  on 
gold  mineral  system  location  and  ore  shoot  geometry  in  order  to  improve  Brownfield 
and  Greenfield  exploration  strategies. Through  a  multiscale  and  multidisciplinary 
approach  including  structural  geology,  petrography,  geochemistry  and  geochronology, 
this  work  presents  the  first  integrated  study  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the  world-class 
Sadiola-Yatela district.",Greenfield,GEO,geotext

The  Paleoproterozoic  belts  of  West  Africa  are  the  fastest-growing  gold

in 
the  world. The  Kédougou-Kénieba 
inlier  (KKI)  represents 
the 
westernmost  exposure  of  Paleoproterozoic  crust  in  the  West  African  Craton,  with 
outcrops in western Mali and eastern Senegal. The KKI is an emerging world-class gold 
province (>40 Moz, cumulative past production and resources), threatening the premier 
position of Ghana in West African gold production. The inlier hosts a number of world-
class  gold  mining  districts  that  are  located  along  regional-scale  shear  zones. Recent 
discoveries  in  the  inlier  have  triggered  a  real  need  for  understanding  the  controls  on 
gold  mineral  system  location  and  ore  shoot  geometry  in  order  to  improve  Brownfield 
and  Greenfield  exploration  strategies. Through  a  multiscale  and  multidisciplinary 
approach  including  structural  geology,  petrography,  geochemistry  and  geochronology,

development  of  the  Sadiola  Hill  mine  began  in  1992  and  was  based  on  proven  and 
probable reserves amounting to 49.2 Mt of oxide and partly oxidized ore at an average 
grade of 2.86 g/t Au, representing approximately 4.5 Moz (141 t) of contained gold to

The  Alamoutala  gold  deposit  is  located  in  the  Kédougou-Kénieba  inlier,  a 
window  of  Paleoproterozoic  rocks  that  outcrop  in  eastern  Senegal  and  western  Mali. The  deposit  is  part  of  the  ~3  Moz  Au  Yatela  district  and  produced  308,400  oz  Au 
between  2002  and  2012. Country  rocks  in  the  Alamoutala  open  pit  consist  of 
limestones, arenites, wackes, and siltstones.",Moz Au Yatela district,regex-GEO,regex
