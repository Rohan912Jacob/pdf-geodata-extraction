mapped  or  researched  to  date. Therefore  the  relationship  between  the  stratigraphy, 
structures  and  intrusive  rocks  is  not  known,  but  it  is  considered  by  Sadiola  mine  geology

are  particularly  interesting  as  they  differ  in  shape  and  origin  from  the  ‘normal’  hexagonal 
pyrite. The pyrite grains of this morphology are formed in alkaline polysulphide solutions and 
the  development  of  octahedral  surfaces  are  a  result  of  slow  rate  of  pyritization  and 
crystallisation in the presence of excess CaSO4 (Graham and Ohmoto, 1994). The marble is very fine grained and completely composed of calcite.",Graham,GEO,geotext

5.1 Depositional Environment 
Slumps  characterise  the  lower  and  upper  slump  facies. A  slump  is  a  mass-transported 
debris  flow  (Martinsen,  1994;  Shanmugam,  2000)  along  the  edge  of  a  continental  margin. They are a downslope movement of sediment and rock material above a basal shear surface 
where  there  is  significant  internal  distortion  of  the  bedding  (Stow,  1986). Slump  structures 
form  when  the  sedimentary  pile  abruptly  detaches  from  a  slope  and  is  transported 
downslope (Collinson et al., 1991). A sediment pile will transport downslope when the shear 
stress acting within a body of sediment exceeds the shear strength along the slope surface 
(Dingle, 1980). The sedimentary pile deforms internally (intensely), and produces a variety of 
deformation  structures  such  as  folds,  boudins,  and  micro-faults  (Martinsen,  1994),  all  of 
which are observed in the study area (Fig.",Stow,GEO,geotext
2008_MATABANE_FE3.txt,37,"10). Ancient  slumps  have  been  reported  in  Country  Clare,  Ireland  and  in  Alexander  Island, 
Antarctica  (Farell,  1984;  Shanmugam,  2000),  and  typically  along  the  edge  of  continental 
margins. The  slumps  of  Country  Clare  in  Ireland  represent  collapsed  slope  deposits  that 
were laid down on an unstable basin slope (Collinson et al., 1991). The slumps of Alexandra 
Island represent mass transported sediments along dislodged from the continental slope into 
a deep marine environments. Modern slumps are common along continental margins and in 
modern  deltas  (  The  Storegga  slumps  in  Norwegian  continental  margin;  Conway  coast  in 
New  Zealand;  Niger  delta  continental  margin;  Mississippi  delta-front  slumps;  slumps  in  the 
gulf of Mexico) (Shanmugam et al.,1988; Jansen et al., 1987; Damuth, 1993; McConnico et 
al., 2007). Slumping can be triggered by gravity, downslope undercutting, and thickening of 
the  sediment  pile  by  deposition,  slumping  up-slope  or  seismic  activity  (Dingle,  1980; 
Martinsen 1994; Betrand et al., 2008).",Conway,GEO,geotext

2.1 Preamble 
The West African craton has been divided into four major domains; the Reguibat Rise, the 
Leo-Man Rise, the Kayes Inlier and the Kéniéba Inlier (Liégeois et al., 1991; Thiéblemont et 
al.,  2004;  Dioh  et  al.,  2006)  (Fig. 2). The  domains  are  separated  by  the  Taoudeni  basin 
which  is  Phanerozoic  in  age  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The  Reguibat  and  the  Leo-Man  domains 
consist of an Archaean terrain in the west and a Palaeoproterozoic terrain in the east (Egal 
et al., 2002; Gueye et al., 2008). The Kéniéba and the Kayes Inliers are Palaeoproterozoic 
terrains (Liégeois et al., 1991) and the study area is situated in the Kéniéba Inlier in Mali. The  Kéniéba  Inlier  has  been  divided  into  the  Mako  Supergroup,  the  Dialé-Dalemé 
Supergroup,  Falemé  volcanic  belt  and  the  Kofi  Series  (Hirdes  et  al.,  2002)  (Fig.",West African craton,regex-GEO,regex
2008_MATABANE_FE3.txt,10,"3). The 
Kéniéba Inlier is a Birimian terrain that was accreted during the Eburnean Orogeny at 2.2- 
2.0  Ga  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Gueye  et  al.,  2008). The  Eburnean 
Orogeny in the Kéniéba Inlier is characterized by the emplacement of calc-alkaline granitoids 
which  intruded  the  volcanic  and  sedimentary  sequences  of  the  inlier  (Leube  et  al.,  1990; 
Dioh  et  al.,  2006). The  post-Eburnean  Senegalo-Malian  graben  lies  east  of  the  Senegalo-
Mali Shear Zone and trends N-S (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Kofi Series overlies the graben in 
Mali; the series has not been dated. The stratigraphic succession of the Kéniéba Inlier is listed in Table 1.",Senegalo- Mali Shear Zone,regex-GEO,regex
