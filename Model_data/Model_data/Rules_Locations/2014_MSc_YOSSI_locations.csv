2014_MSc_YOSSI.txt,8,"The results of simple models 
can be used to select the type of geophysical method for future data collection. This stage is direct or 
forward modelling (analytical modelling), and the construction of a model from the data surveyed is 
inverse modelling (numerical modelling). According to Wijns (2004), numerical modelling is affected by two factors including: 
1. The  distance,  corresponding  to  the  error  between  the  initial  and  final  model. This  error  is 
considered to be an accumulation of errors from the initial  model  to the final model, and is 
equal to the sum of errors from the beginning of the collection of data to the production of the

2014_MSc_YOSSI.txt,9,"when choosing a reliable model that matches and responds well to the real distribution of subsurface 
properties among a multitude of other solutions. Also  most  geological  structures  are  not  detectable  by  only  one  geophysical  method,  which 
therefore  requires  a  combination  of  several  geophysical  methods  to  constrain  structures  and 
geological  domains. The  combination  of  geophysical  methods  is  an  optimization  that  supports  the 
geophysical interpretation and contributes in determining the geological elements that are important in 
developing an understanding of the subsurface geology. The limitation in optimisation is the cost of 
applying multiple geophysical techniques and methods. With this in mind, this project aims to use a combination of geophysical methods for modelling 
by integrating the available geological data to build a 3D geophysical model of the study area, and to 
interpret  geological  structures  and  geological  domains. Specifically,  the  aims  are  to  (1)  establish 
tectonic domains in the south of Mali and northeast of Guinea; (2) to determine if structures (shears, 
faults, etc.) beneath the thin sedimentary cover (up to 100m) potential to host structurally-hosted gold
