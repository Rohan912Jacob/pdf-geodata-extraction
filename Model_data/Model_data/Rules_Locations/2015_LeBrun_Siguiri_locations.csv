The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as 
Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri. However,  the  Craton  is  still  largely  unexplored  and  its 
formation,  evolution  and  how  and  when  the  gold  deposits  it  hosts  developed  during  the

constrain the evolution of the  Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin architecture and hydrothermal

1)  Characterise  the  lithostratigraphy  and  tectonic  significance  of  the  Siguiri  district  and

2)  Use  this  newly  developed  understanding  to  highlight  the  early  architecture  of  the 
Siguiri Basin and the large scale structures which may have played a fundamental role 
in the location of the Siguiri district;

major  structures  and  deformation  events  in  the  context  of  previous  structural  work

GENERAL METHODOLOGY 
This  section  briefly  details  the  different  methods  and  techniques  used  to  meet  the 
defined objectives of this study. Fieldwork and sampling 
In  order  to  achieve  the  objectives  identified  in  the  previous  section,  fieldwork  was 
conducted in and around the Siguiri district. A total of 22 weeks were spent in the field over 
the  course  of  this  study. Fieldwork  was  focused  on  geological  and  structural  mapping,  core 
logging and sampling in the  different  deposits of the district  but  was  also conducted around 
the district and outside of the Siguiri Basin. Thirteen deposits from the Siguiri district were accessible over the course of this study. From  south  to  north:  Sintroko  PB1,  Sintroko  PB2C,  Sintroko  PB3A,  Sintroko  North,  Kosise,

observations and sampling: the Maléa monzogranite region, ~30 km north of the district, and 
the  Saraya  greenfield  project  ~50 km to the  west of  the  district. The  Maléa  site  was  chosen 
because  this  monzogranite  represents  the  closest  and  largest  mapped  pluton  intruding  the 
sediments  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. Dating  of  this  intrusive  hence  gives  a  minimum  age  for  the

PETROGRAPHY AND IMAGING 
Petrographic observations of polished thin-sections were undertaken at the Centre for 
Exploration  Targeting 
(CET) 
in  Perth,  Western  Australia. These  observations  were 
complemented  by  Secondary  Electron  Microscope  (SEM)  imaging  on  a  Tescan  Vega  3  at  the 
Centre  for  Microscopy,  Characterisation  and  Analysis  (CMCA)  at  the  University  of  Western

Chapter four. U-PB SHRIMP GEOCHRONOLOGY 
U-Pb SHRIMP II geochronology on detrital and igneous zircons was carried out at the 
John  de  Laeter  Centre  for  Isotope  Research  (JdL)  at  Curtin  University  in  Perth,  Western 
Australia. The use of an ion microprobe was  essential for the high precision and small beam 
size required, as well as for logistical reasons. This technique spatial resolution (20 μm ablation 
diameter versus 30-60 μm for LA-ICP-MS) allows for the very small detrital zircons and highly 
damaged  igneous  zircons  collected  to  be  analysed  while  avoiding  cracked,  damaged  or

The West African Craton hosts some of the biggest gold deposits in the world such as 
Obuasi,  Sadiola,  Morila  or  Siguiri. However,  the  Craton  is  still  largely  unexplored  and  its 
formation,  evolution  and  how  and  when  the  gold  deposits  it  hosts  developed  during  the 
Eburnean  orogeny  remain  unclear. The  Siguiri  district  is  one  of  West  Africa's  largest 
Paleoproterozoic  sedimentary  basins  and  sits  in  the  northern  part  of  the  Siguiri  Basin. The 
district and its hosting Basin have received limited attention from the scientific community to 
date. This  thesis  makes  use  of  a  multi-scale  and  multi-disciplinary  approach  in  order  to 
constrain the evolution of the  Siguiri district and Siguiri Basin architecture and hydrothermal 
activity through time. The objective is to provide the backbone of future exploration strategies 
for orogenic gold deposits in the Siguiri Basin and, potentially, in the rest of the West African 
Craton.",Siguiri,GEO,geotext

4D EVOLUTION OF THE OROGENIC GOLD DISTRICT OF 
SIGUIRI, GUINEA (WEST AFRICA) 
PREAMBLE AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS 
The West African Craton (WAC) is also known as the Leo-Man Shield. It is made of two 
distinct  terranes:  the  Archean  Kénéma-Man  domain  to  the  south-west,  and  the 
Paleoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  (Figure  1A). The  Archean  domain  is  dominated  by 
gneiss  dated  between  ca. 3540  and  2750  Ma  (Kouamelan  et  al.,  1997;  Thiéblemont  et  al., 
2001) while the Paleoproterozoic domain displays an assemblage of volcano-sedimentary belts 
and felsic intrusives, ranging in age from ca. 2250 to 2040 Ma (Davis et al., 2015; Parra-Avila, 
2015;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2013). A  large  part  of  the  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  is  overlain 
unconformably  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  Basin  (Begg  et  al.,  2009; 
Lawrence et al., 2013a; Villeneuve and Cornée, 1994).",Lawrence,GEO,geotext
2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,31,"To the south, the Siguiri Basin is bordered by a series of 
late  Eburnean intrusives (ca. 2090-2070 Ma) and by the Sassandra fault separating the Basin 
sediments from the Archean Kénéma-Man gneiss (Egal et al., 2002). The Archean banded iron 
formations of the Simandou also outcrop south of the Siguiri Basin (Egal et al., 1999). Finally, to 
the north, the Siguiri Basin is unconformably overlain by the Neoproterozoic sediments of the 
Taoudeni  Basin. The  Siguiri  Basin  sediments  are  intruded  by  a  number  of  late  Eburnean 
monzogranite  and  biotite  granite  intrusions  dated  at  ca. 2090-2070  Ma  such  as  the  Malea

2015_LeBrun_Siguiri.txt,32,"Even  though  all  these  studies  propose  that  gold  mineralisation  in  Siguiri  is  dominantly 
controlled by veins, no consensus was reached by the authors on what controls the location of 
the Siguiri gold district at the scale of the Siguiri Basin or what controls the extent of the ore 
shoots at the district and deposit scales. To  further  the  understanding  of  the  characteristics,  geometry  and  genesis  of  gold 
mineralisation  in  the  Siguiri  district,  a  multi-scale  and  multidisciplinary  approach  was 
employed. This  approach  addresses  the  various  scales  at  which  geological  processes  work  in 
gold  mineral  systems. Modern  gold  exploration  strategies  increasingly  rely  on  such  an 
approach,  involving  integration  of  fieldwork,  geophysics,  and  geochemistry  among  other 
techniques, used at different scales (McCuaig and Hronsky, 2014; McCuaig et al., 2010; Robert

2008; Eilu and Groves, 2001; Eilu et al., 1999). At a province scale, numerous studies highlight 
the role of early architecture as a primary control on gold mineralisation (Robert et al., 2005; 
Miller et al., 2010; McIntyre and Martyn, 2005; Chapter two). Down one  scale at the  district 
level,  secondary  structures  control  and/or  host  gold  mineralisation  (Blewett  et  al.,  2010;

Abstract: 
Geochronology  and  lithostratigraphic  characterisation  of  the  Siguiri  district  in  the 
Paleoproterozoic Birimian terrane of West Africa has provided a reappraisal of the Siguiri Basin 
stratigraphy. This  new  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the  central  part  of  the  Basin  further 
highlights  first  order controls on the location of the world class Siguiri orogenic gold district. Three metasedimentary Formations occur in the Siguiri district, namely: the Balato, Fatoya and 
Kintinian  Formations. These  consist  of  fine-grained  organic-rich  shales,  mudstone  and 
siltstone/greywacke/limestone  interbeds,  decimetre  to  metre-thick  graded  greywacke  beds 
and  debris  flow  deposits. The  Balato  Formation  displays  low-energy,  hemipelagic  marine  or

Regardless  of  the  timing  of  mineralisation,  it  has  been  demonstrated  in  several 
terranes  of  varying  age  that  the  structural  framework  associated  with  mineralisation  is 
intimately controlled by the early architecture (Dörling et al., 1996; Love et al., 2004; Garwin et 
al., 2005; Lund, 2008; Miller et al., 2010). Early architecture is crucial for exploration targeting 
and major stratigraphic boundaries are commonly used in orogenic gold exploration (Robert et 
al.,  2005). These  boundaries  and  variations  within  a  basin  are  typically  controlled  by,  and 
therefore highlight, fundamental structures that were active at the time of the basin formation 
(Ersoy  et  al.,  2014;  Collins  et  al.,  in  press;  Gindre  et  al.,  2012;  Hajná  et  al.,  2011).",Lund,GEO,geotext

(Figure 20A). These veins, whose orientation varies across the deposit, are typically only a few 
millimeters to 5 centimeters thick. Multiple sub-vertical damage zones, oriented NE-SW and N-

typically associated with the main phase of gold mineralization. However, this event does not 
appear to be mineralized in the Siguiri district. Finally, Steyn (2012) recognized a last deformation event, termed D3, associated with

Based  on  the  structural  elements  observed,  and  their  relative  timing,  a  stress-field 
reconstruction was undertaken in the Siguiri district for the syn-D2S ductile and early- to late-
D3S brittle part of the deformation history. Paleo-stress reconstruction for the syn-D2S ductile 
part  of  the  deformation  history,  was  based  on  the  geometry  of  the  F2S  folds  and  the 
orientations  of  their  axial  planes. The  reconstruction  of  the  paleo-stress  orientations  for  the 
D3S  brittle  part  of  the  deformation  history  was  based  on  fault  and  V3B  conjugate  vein 
orientations  assuming  that  locally,  the  Andersonian  fault  and  Mohr-Coulomb  failure  models 
prevailed at the time of faulting and that all V3B conjugate veins were not following pre-existing 
structures. The orientation of σ1 was reconstructed as bisecting the acute angle between two 
conjugate  veins,  while  σ2  lays  at  their  intersection  and  σ3  bisects  the  obtuse  angle  the 
conjugate  makes  (Anderson,  1951;  McClay,  1992). This  analysis  was  only  based  on  V3B 
conjugate sets across the whole district since data from the V3A vein set were insufficient. The D2S E-W compressional event, highlighted by the N-S trending F2S fold axial planes, 
indicates it was related to a horizontal main stress axis (σ1) and a vertical σ3, or overburden 
pressure  (Figure  29A).",Anderson,GEO,geotext

remained  consistently  sub-horizontal  and  oriented  to  the  NNW. Such  a  stress-field 
configuration  is  indicative of  transtensional  deformation  during  V3B  veining  (Figure  29C). The 
change in stress-shape ratio from early-D3S transpression where the coeval movement of dip-
slip and strike-slip faults indicate that σ2 ≈ σ3 (low stress-shape ratio; Miller and Wilson, 2004; 
Figure 29B) to syn-V3B (late-D3S) gold mineralization (with σ1 ≈ σ2; Figure 29C) is interpreted to 
have  resulted  from  the  joint  reduction  of  the  maximum  stress  (σ1)  and  further  increase  in 
overburden (σ3 switches to σ2). This is interpreted to have occurred at an early stage of the 
D3S  transpressional event  while  all  fault  orientations  were  active  as  fluid  conduits  facilitating 
the upward migration of mineralizing fluids (Figure 29B and 29C). Stress-switches, precursors or triggers to mineralization 
The timing of gold mineralization during the waning stages of the progressive D2S/D3S 
deformation  is  interpreted  to  have  been  associated  with  the  transtensional  regime  during 
mineralization. This  reflects  the  greater  ease  for  overpressured  fluids,  to  open  fault-fracture

Orogenic gold deposits typically encompass a wide variety of host rocks, metamorphic 
facies, mineral assemblages and textures, with variations sometimes observed within a single 
deposit (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Robert et al., 2005; Groves et al., 2003). Finding the footprint of 
orogenic gold mineralisation therefore represents a great challenge for explorers (e.g. Groves 
et al., 2000; Neumayr et al., 2008). However, as the geochemical and petrological footprints of 
orogenic  gold  deposits  are  more  extensive  than  the  ore  zone  itself  (Eilu  and  Mikucki,  1998; 
Kishida and Kerrich, 1987), characterisation of mineral alteration assemblages  at the deposit 
scale  provides  the  exploration  geologist  with  useful  vectoring  tools  for  targeting  (Eilu  and 
Groves,  2001;  Eilu  et  al.,  1999). With  the  development  in  recent  years  of  laser  ablation 
inductively  coupled  plasma  mass  spectrometry  (LA-ICP-MS)  techniques  and  associated  low 
detection  limits,  studies  on  the  characterization  and  quantification  of  trace  elements  in 
sulphides  associated  with  orogenic  gold  deposits  have  become  more  common  (Large  et  al., 
2011; Large et al., 2012; Pitcairn et al., 2006). These studies typically focus on the use of LA-
ICP-MS  data  acquired  on  sulphides  to  resolve  the  controversial  source  of  mineralising  fluids

highlighted by the covariance in the LA-ICP-MS and EPMA datasets of Au and As in V3A pyrite: 
more  Au  is  incorporated  into  the  pyrite  crystal  lattice  along  with  the  increase  in  As  (Figure 
45F). The low As content of the Kintinian Formation is thus interpreted to be responsible for 
the low Au content of the syn-V3B pyrite disseminated in the Kintinian conglomerate below the 
Bidini deposit and outcropping in the Sanu Tinti deposit. Comparison with other West African orogenic gold deposits 
The  Siguiri  mineralisation  footprint  has  many  similarities  with  other  West  African 
orogenic gold deposits. In particular, mineralisation at the Massawa deposit in Eastern Senegal 
(Treloar et al., 2014) is structurally controlled and hosted along sub-vertical NE-trending shear 
zones similar to the Kosise deposit.",Savage,GEO,geotext

similar to that found in the Bidini-Sanu Tinti conglomerate and is associated with carbonate-
sericite alteration. This first  mineralisation event in Massawa  is overprinted by late Au-Sb-Te

Abstract: 
Geochronology  and  lithostratigraphic  characterisation  of  the  Siguiri  district  in  the 
Paleoproterozoic Birimian terrane of West Africa has provided a reappraisal of the Siguiri Basin 
stratigraphy. This  new  insight  into  the  evolution  of  the  central  part  of  the  Basin  further 
highlights  first  order controls on the location of the world class Siguiri orogenic gold district. Three metasedimentary Formations occur in the Siguiri district, namely: the Balato, Fatoya and 
Kintinian  Formations. These  consist  of  fine-grained  organic-rich  shales,  mudstone  and 
siltstone/greywacke/limestone  interbeds,  decimetre  to  metre-thick  graded  greywacke  beds 
and  debris  flow  deposits. The  Balato  Formation  displays  low-energy,  hemipelagic  marine  or

the  world  are  interpreted  to  be  sitting  on  early  structures  highlighted  in  the  field  through 
lithofacies  variations. For  example,  the  Kirkland  Lake  deposit  hosted  along  the  Kirkland-Lake 
Cadillac fault that marks the unconformity between the Timiskaming sediments and the Abitibi 
Supergroup  in  Canada  (Hyde,  1980). Similarly  in  the  Western  Australian  Yilgarn  craton,  gold 
deposits such as Ant Hill, Bullant, Porphyry and Wattlebird are hosted along the Ballard-Zuleika 
Shear Zone and highlighted by the Kurrawang Group sediments (Robert et al., 2005; Mueller et 
al., 1996; Weinberg et al., n.d.). In the West African Craton, the giant Obuasi deposit in Ghana

STRUCTURAL CONTROLS ON THE WORLD-CLASS SIGUIRI 
GOLD DISTRICT, SIGUIRI BASIN, GUINEA, WEST AFRICA 
The following paper presents the structural framework associated with the Siguiri gold 
district  and  its  evolution  through  the  Eburnean  orogeny. The  study  is  based  on  field 
observations, geophysical datasets, drill core logging and petrographic observations. This work 
focuses  on  district  and  deposit-scale  observations  of  the  second  and  third  order  structures 
controlling  gold  mineralisation. It  describes  the  different  structural  features  encountered  in 
the  Siguiri  district  and  the  link  they  have  with  gold  mineralisation. This  paper  discusses  the 
deformation  history  of  the  Siguiri  district,  the  development  of  gold  mineralisation  in  the 
district and the stress-field variations associated with this mineralisation. Based on this work, 
four  deformation  events  were  recognized  to  affect  the  Siguiri  district  sediments:  a  N-S 
compression  (D1S),  an  E-W  compression  (D2S)  interpreted  to  progressively  evolve  into

found to be  polyphase  and  to have  occurred mainly  during D3S,  but  was  interpreted to have 
also occurred during D4S deformation. The timing of gold mineralisation in the Siguiri district is
