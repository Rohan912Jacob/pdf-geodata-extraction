Abstract 
The  FE3  open  casts  (Sadiola  goldfield,  Mali)  are  operated  by  the  by  the  Société 
d’Exploitation des Mines d’Or de Sadiola S.A.. The open casts comprise meta-sedimentary 
rocks  that  can  be  divided  into  five  units;  lower  slump  facies,  upper  slump  facies,  siltstone-
greywacke  unit,  greywacke  unit  and  a  laterite  profile.  The  lower  slump  facies  consists  of 
siltstone beds and is characterised by massive chaotic slump folds and olistoliths. The upper 
slump  facies  consists  of  greywacke-siltstone  beds  and  is  characterised  by  turbidite  beds, 
slump  folds  and  fluid  escape  structures.  The  siltstone-greywacke  unit  is  characterised  by 
turbidite beds. The greywacke unit is carbonaceous.  
The  sediments  of  the  lower  slump  facies,  upper  slump  facies  and  the  siltstone-greywacke 
unit  are  interpreted  to  have  been  deposited  in  a  seismically-active  turbulent  environment, 
with mass transport and debris flow along a delta-front. The greywacke unit is interpreted to 
represent a significant change in the depositional environment, from a slump dominant pro-
delta to shallow marine setting.  
The sedimentary units are crosscut by granodiorite dykes. The granodiorite dykes are form 
part of the Sekokoto pluton (granodiorite-tonalite). The sedimentary units have been contact 
metamorphosed around the granodiorite dykes.  
Primary hydrothermal gold mineralisation occurs in the contact aureole around the dykes in 
the lower slump facies, and in breccia zones and quartz-arsenopyrite veins that crosscut the 
sedimentary units. The primary gold mineralisation is associated with hydrothermal chlorite-
sericite  alteration  which  is  related  to  hydrothermal  fluids  that  are  interpreted  to  have 
originated  from  the  granodiorite  dykes.  Secondary  placer  gold  mineralisation  occur  in 
palaeochannels  that  cross-cut  the  sedimentary  units  and  the  primary  gold  mineralisation. 
The  placer  gold  mineralisation  is  interpreted  to  have  been  derived  from  erosion  of  the 
primary hydrothermal mineralisation.

Chapter 1: Introduction 
1.1 Preamble 
The FE3 open cast is situated in the Sadiola goldfield in Mali. The goldfield also includes the 
giant Sadiola and FE4 open casts which are mined by the Société d’Exploitation des Mines 
d’Or  de  Sadiola  S.A.,  and  is  a  Joint  Venture  partnership  between  AngloGold  Ashanti, 
IAMGOLD, the Malian Government and the IFC. Gold production at Sadiola goldfield began 
in mid-1997: the FE3 open cast is currently in the feasibility stages. 
The  geology  and  metallogenic  setting  of  the  FE3  open  cast  has  not  been  investigated, 
mapped  or  researched  to  date.  Therefore  the  relationship  between  the  stratigraphy, 
structures  and  intrusive  rocks  is  not  known,  but  it  is  considered  by  Sadiola  mine  geology 
team to be important in determining the tectonic setting and the timing of gold mineralization 
in the goldfield.  
Therefore  the  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  describe  the  stratigraphy,  structure  and 
intrusive rocks that occur in the goldfield. Also the tectonic setting and the relative timing of 
gold mineralization will be determined. Determining the relative timing of gold mineralization 
will  assist  in  predicting  the  occurrence  of  gold  in  new  exploration  projects  in  the  Sadiola 
area.  
1.2 Location and physiography 
The FE3 open cast is located in the Sadiola area in Mali, West Africa. The Sadiola goldfield 
is located 80 km west of the capital city of Bamako on the western border of Senegal and 
Mali  (Fig.  1).  Mali  is  a  landlocked,  Sahel  country  and  is  mostly  semi-desert  or  desert.  The 
climate ranges from sub-tropical in the south to arid in the north. The country is mostly dry, 
but  in  the  south  of  the  country,  and  at  the  Sadiola  goldfield,  4-5  months  of  rainy  season 
significantly  affects  mining  operations.  December  and  January  are  the  driest  and  coldest 
months of the year with zero rainfall, and temperature ranging from 16°C to 33°C.  
The field component of this study took place in January 2008 before the rainy season started 
and  temperatures  peaked.  During  the  dry  season  a  dry,  dust-laden  harmattan  haze  is 
common and this reduces visibility. 
Mali’s official language is French but African languages are widely used; 80% of population 
speaks  Bambara.  The  majority  of  Mali’s  population  is  Muslim.  A  small  percentage  of  the 
population practice indigenous religion and Christianity.

Malaria and other arthropod-borne diseases prevail in Mali and high rates of children suffer 
from malnutrition. Mali is very poor and one of the poorest countries in the world.  
Mining  is  a  significant  component  to  Mali’s  economy  and  accounted  for  26%  of  gross 
domestic product (GDP) in 2005, with gold mining accounting for 80% of mining activity (US 
Department of State, 2008 ). 
1.3 Aims and objectives 
The  main  objective  of  the  project  is  to  define  the  stratigraphy  in  the  study  area  by  sub-
dividing the facies successions. Furthermore, detailed mapping of structures (if present) will 
be  done  with  the  purpose  of  determining  the  relative  timing  of  structural  events.  Another 
objective  of  the  project  will  be  mapping  of  the  intrusive  bodies  and  determining  their 
relationship to stratigraphy and structure. The timing of gold metallogenesis and processes 
that led to gold formation will be investigated.

Chapter 2: Regional geology 
2.1 Preamble 
The West African craton has been divided into four major domains; the Reguibat Rise, the 
Leo-Man Rise, the Kayes Inlier and the Kéniéba Inlier (Liégeois et al., 1991; Thiéblemont et 
al.,  2004;  Dioh  et  al.,  2006)  (Fig.  2).  The  domains  are  separated  by  the  Taoudeni  basin 
which  is  Phanerozoic  in  age  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006).  The  Reguibat  and  the  Leo-Man  domains 
consist of an Archaean terrain in the west and a Palaeoproterozoic terrain in the east (Egal 
et al., 2002; Gueye et al., 2008). The Kéniéba and the Kayes Inliers are Palaeoproterozoic 
terrains (Liégeois et al., 1991) and the study area is situated in the Kéniéba Inlier in Mali. 
The  Kéniéba  Inlier  has  been  divided  into  the  Mako  Supergroup,  the  Dialé-Dalemé 
Supergroup,  Falemé  volcanic  belt  and  the  Kofi  Series  (Hirdes  et  al.,  2002)  (Fig.  3).  The 
Kéniéba Inlier is a Birimian terrain that was accreted during the Eburnean Orogeny at 2.2- 
2.0  Ga  (Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Gueye  et  al.,  2008).  The  Eburnean 
Orogeny in the Kéniéba Inlier is characterized by the emplacement of calc-alkaline granitoids 
which  intruded  the  volcanic  and  sedimentary  sequences  of  the  inlier  (Leube  et  al.,  1990; 
Dioh  et  al.,  2006).  The  post-Eburnean  Senegalo-Malian  graben  lies  east  of  the  Senegalo-
Mali Shear Zone and trends N-S (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Kofi Series overlies the graben in 
Mali; the series has not been dated.  
The stratigraphic succession of the Kéniéba Inlier is listed in Table 1. The Birimian rocks of 
the  Kéniéba  Inlier  unconformably  overlie  the  Sandikounda  Amphibolite-Gneiss  (SAG) 
basement (Dia et al., 1997). The basement consists of dioritic to tonalitic rocks aged at 2194 
± 6 (Dia et al., 1997, Pb-Pb age; Pawlig et al., 2006, T DM Sm-Nd). The oldest Birimian rocks 
of  the  inlier  are  tholeiitic  basalts  and  andesites  of  the  Mako  Supergroup,  which 
unconformably overlie the SAG basement.  These volcanic sequences are dated at 2195±11 
Ma (Dia et al, 1997; detrital zircons, Pb-Pb age) and at 2063±41 Ma (Abouchami, 1990; Sm-
Nd).  The  Mako  Supergroup  is  overlain  by  the  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  which  consists  of 
Birimian sequences dated at 2096±8 Ma (Ledru et al, 1991; Pb-zircon evaporation; Hirdes et 
al.,  2002).  The  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  is  overlain  by  the  Falemé  volcanic  belt  which  is 
dated at 2099±4 Ma (Hirdes et al., 2002; Pb-Pb age). The Kofi Series, which outcrops only in 
Mali, overlies the volcanic belt and has not been dated (Dioh et al., 2006).  
The sequences are intruded by Eburnean granitoids aged at 2045±27 to 1973±33 Ma (Ledru 
et  al,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Pb-Pb;  Pawlig  et  al.,  2006).  The  post-Eburnean  age 
Senegalo-Mali  graben  is  located  between  the  Falemé  volcanic  belt  and  Kofi  Series  and  is 
10

--- Page 11 ---
interpreted to have formed during activation on the Senegalo-Mali Shear Zone (Bassot et al., 
1986 in Pawlig et al., 2006). 
2.2 Basement rocks 
The Sandikounda Amphibolite Gneiss Complex (SAG Complex) forms the basement to the 
Mako Supergroup. It consists of two major components; Banded Gneiss and the Sonfarara 
unit  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008).  The  Banded  Gneiss  consists  of  heterogeneous  associations  of 
diorite to tonalite, while the Sonfarara unit comprises amphibolite that has been interpreted 
as xenoliths (approx. 500m in diameter) with a metamorphic ‘compositional banding’ (Dia et 
al., 1997; Pawlig et al. 2006; Gueye et al., 2008). 
2.3 Mako Supergroup 
The  Mako  Supergroup  is  predominantly  composed  of  tholeiitic  pillowed  basalt  and  calc-
alkaline  andesite.  These  meta-volcanic  rocks  are  inter-layered  with  immature  meta-
sedimentary and meta-volcaniclastic rocks (Hirdes et al., 2002; Dioh et al., 2006). 
2.4 Dialé-Dalemé Supergroup 
The  Dialé-Dalemé  Supergroup  is  composed  of  meta-sedimentary  sequences  inter-bedded 
with calc-alkaline volcanics (Pawlig et al., 2006). The meta-sedimentary sequences consist 
of intercalations of carbonate, volcaniclastic, siliciclastic and turbiditic units (Schwartz et al., 
2004).  The  volcanic  sequences  consist  of  andesite  lavas,  with  rhyolitic  pyroclastites 
(Schwartz et al., 2004; Dioh et al., 2006). 
2.5 Falemé volcanic belt 
The  Falemé  volcanic  belt  is  poorly  exposed  and  extensively  latteritised  throughout  the 
Kéniéba Inlier. Hirdes et al. (2002) concluded that andesite and felsic lava dominant the belt, 
but volcaniclastic units, chemical sediments (e.g., chert and manganiferous shale) and meta-
greywacke  also  occur  throughout  the  volcanic  belt.  Hirdes  et  al.  (2002)  interpreted  these 
sequences  as  proximal  volcanic  rocks.  The  Falemé  volcanic  belt  is  associated  with  major 
skarn-type iron deposits (Schwartz et al., 2004). 
2.6 Kofi Series 
The Kofi Series crops out east of the Senegalo-Mali Shear Zone and is sinistrally displaced 
(Hirdes  et  al.,  2002).  The  series  consists  of  Birimian-type  basin  sediments,  and  includes 
orogenic-type  metasediments  and  volcaniclastic  sequences.  The  series  is  crosscut  by 
numerous tourmaline-rich quartz veins which host gold mineralisation in the Loulo goldfield 
(Fig. 1) southeast of the study area (Fouillac et al., 1993). 
11

--- Page 12 ---
2.7 Intrusive rocks 
The Birimian sequences of the Kéniéba Inlier are intruded by calc-alkaline granitoids (TTG 
suite)  that  were  emplaced  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  at  2200-2000  Ma  (Leube  et  al., 
1990;  Eisenlohr  et  al.,  1991;  Hirdes  et  al.,  2002).  Two  major  magmatic  events  have  been 
identified  in  the  Kéniéba  Inlier;  at  2.16-2.11  Ga  and  at  2.08-2.07  Ga  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008). 
The  early  magmatic  event  resulted  in  the  emplacement  of  the  Badon-Kakadian  batholith; 
then later resulted in the emplacement of the late granitoids of the Saraya batholith (Gueye 
et al., 2008). 
The 120 km long Badon-Kakadian batholith intrudes the Mako Supergroup and consists of 
numerous  TTG  suite  plutons  and  a  layered  plutonic  complex  (Dioh  et  al.,  2006).  The 
complex  is  composed  of  werhlite,  pyroxenite,  gabbro  and  diorite  (Gueye  et  al.,  2008).  The 
batholith  also  hosts  granitoids  that  are  dated  at  2199±68  Ma  (Bassot  and  Caen-Vachette, 
1984 in Ledru et al., 1991; Rb-Sr whole rock; Gueye et al., 2008). 
The Saraya batholith intrudes the Dialé-Dalemé Supergroup and includes the Balangouma 
and Boboti plutons (Hirdes et al., 2002). The Saraya batholith is composed of biotite-bearing 
tonalite to granite, while the Boboti and Balangoma plutons comprise gabbro to amphibole-
biotite bearing monzogranite (Dioh et al., 2006) that are dated at 1973±33 Ma (Ledru et al., 
1991; Rb-Sr). The Falemé volcanic belt is intruded by Na-rich, belt-type granitoids (Dioh et 
al., 2006). 
2.8 Metamorphism 
During the Eburnean Orogeny, the Birimian meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary sequences 
of  the  Kéniéba  Inlier  were  subjected  to  regional  metamorphism  to  greenschist  facies 
(Liégeois  et  al.,  1991;  Taylor  et  al.,  1992;  Debat  et  al.,  2003).  The  contact  aureole  of 
granitoids  are  characterised  by  staurolite-sillimanite-garnet  mineral  assemblages  indicating 
that  metamorphism  reached  amphibolite  facies  in  grade  (Debat  et  al.,  2003;  Pawlig  et  al., 
2006). Peak metamorphic conditions reached 500-600 ˚C and 4-6 kbar and has been dated 
at approximately 2.1 Ga, which falls in the time interval of the Eburnean Orogeny (Hirdes et 
al., 2002; Pawlig et al., 2006, U-Pb age on sphene). 
2.9 Regional Structure 
The  rocks  of  the  Kéniéba  Inlier  were  deformed  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  at  2.1  Ga 
(Milési  et  al.,  1992).  Two  major  strike-slip  shear  zones  dominate  the  Inlier;  the  Senegalo-
Malian Shear Zone and the Main Transcurrent Zone (Ledru et al, 1991) (Fig. 4). Ledru et al. 
12

--- Page 13 ---
(1991)  reported  four  phases  of  structural  evolution;  an  extensional  phase  during  the 
deposition of Birimian sequences, a compressional phase (referred to as D1), an Eburnean 
compressional  tectonic  phase  and  a  late  extensional  phase.  The  early  Birimian  and  the 
extensional phase are marked by the deposition of clastic sediments, intense hydrothermal 
activity,  and  emplacement  of  tholeiitic  lavas  and  dykes.  These  lavas  and  dykes  are 
interpreted to indicate a period of extensional tectonism during their emplacement (Milési et 
al.,  1989  in  Ledru  et  al.,  1991).  This  resulted  in  the  formation  of  the  Lower  Birimian 
sequences. 
A  compressional  phase  (D1)  affected  the  lower  Birimian  sequences  and  indicates  a  fairly 
high crustal level tectonic activity with tendency towards thrusting (Ledru et al., 1991).  
The Eburnean orogeny followed extension and accompanied the formation of major sinistral 
strike-slip  shear  zones  and  the  emplacement  of  granite  bodies  (Ledru  et  al.,  1991).  There 
are  two  hypothesis  proposed  for  the  Eburnean  tectonics;  1.  a  general  NW-SE  crustal 
shortening  with  associated  strike-slip  faulting,  and  2.  transcurrent  deformation  (Lemoine  et 
al., 1990; Milési et al., 1992; Watkins et al., 1993; Pons et al., 1995; Dioh et al., 2006) . The 
hypothesis  of  transcurrent  deformation  has  been  generally  accepted  and  the  major  shear 
zones  are  assumed  to  have  been  active  over  a  period  of  50  million  years  as  there  is 
evidence of sinistral strike-slip faults in the  oldest intrusions of the Kéniéba Inlier (Ledru et 
al.,  1991).  Subsequent  strike-slip  shearing  was  initiated  along  fractures  formed  during  the 
late extensional phase. 
2.10 Gold metallogeny in West Africa 
West African gold production has a long history. In the 16th century, the Gold Coast of West 
Africa accounted for 35% of the entire world’s gold production although gold production had 
decreased  significantly  since  that  time  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008).  Major  gold  deposits  occur  in 
Ghana, Burkina Faso and Mali. The Ghanaian gold province is the largest in West Africa and 
is considered a world-class gold deposit region (Komla, 1993). Ghana and Mali are currently 
the second and third largest gold producers in Africa, respectively (Middleton, 2007). 
Three  types  of  primary  deposit  have  been  distinguished  in  West  Africa;  pre-orogenic 
stratiform  deposits;  syn-orogenic  deposits;  late-orogenic  discordant  mesothermal  gold 
mineralization  (Milési  et  al.,  1992).  Pre-orogenic  stratiform  deposits  have  been  reported  in 
the  Loulo  district  of  Mali,  which  hosts  tourmalinised  turbidite.  The  deposits  are  associated 
with  earlier  extensional  zones  (Fouillac  et  al.,  1993;  Béziat  et  al.,  2008)  and  occur 
predominantly  within  Lower  Birimian  sequences.  Syn-orogenic  deposits  include  gold 
13

--- Page 14 ---
mineralization 
in  disseminated  sulphides 
in  volcanic  and  plutonic  rocks  and  gold 
mineralization in conglomerate beds (Milési et al., 1992). These types of deposits have been 
reported  in  Burkina  Faso  (Diénémera),  Ghana  (Tarkwa  district),  Mali  (Syama),  and  Ivory 
Coast (Yaouré-Angovia) (Milési et al., 1992; Feybesse et al., 2006). Syn-orogenic deposits 
are related to brecciated hydrothermal zones. 
Late  orogenic  discordant  mesothermal  gold  mineralisation  includes  gold-arsenopyrite  lode 
mineralization  and  quartz  lode  mineralization  with  native  gold  and  poly-metallic  sulphides 
(Béziat  et  al.,  2008).  Discordant  mesothermal  mineralization  (auriferous  arsenopyrite  and 
Au-bearing  quartz  vein  lodes)  are  reported  in  Ghana  (Ashanti,  Pretea,  Marlu,  Bogosu, 
Konongo), Ivory Coast (Asupiri and Anuiri) and Mali (Sanoukou district) (Milési et al., 1992). 
Gold mineralization occurs within NE-trending tectonic corridors that are several kilometres 
long (Ledru et al., 1988 in Milési et al., 1992; Feybesse et al., 2006).  
Quartz lode mineralization with poly-metallic sulphides is interpreted to have formed during 
the  last  brittle  to  brittle-ductile  stages  of  the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Béziat  et  al.,  2008).  This 
type  of  deposits  has  been  reported  in  Mali  (Kalanga),  Guinea  (Banora),  Burkina  Faso 
(Poura),  Senegal  (Sabodala)  and  Ivory  Coast  (Hiré)  (Milési  et  al.,  1992).  Gold-bearing 
arsenopyrite  lode  mineralization  predates  quartz  lode  mineralization,  but  they  are  locally 
superimposed.

Chapter 3: Methodology 
3.1 Data collection 
Field mapping of the FE3 open casts was completed in January 2008. At each station point, 
the  facies  were  mapped,  lithological  data  was  recorded  and  the  GPS  coordinates  were 
established.  Also,  where  appropriate  a  photographic  record  was  made  and  samples  were 
collected for petrographic studies. 
The  data  was  captured  using  a  northern  hemisphere  compass  clinometer,  and  the 
geographic  coordinates  were  recorded  using  a  Garmin  GPS.  The  GPS  station  data  used 
UTM coordination system, WGS 84 datum. The point data was transferred onto mine maps. 
The  mine  maps  were  converted  from  mine  grid  coordinates  to  UTM  coordinates  by 
measuring fixed points in the field and then transferring the data onto base maps. A hand-
lens was used for mineral identification in the field. 
Stratigraphic  facies  were  subdivided  and  the  lithologies  within  the  facies  were  recorded. 
Facing direction was determined using primary sedimentary features such as, scour and fill, 
cross-bedding,  and  turbidite  sequences.  Also,  the  orientation  of  the  structures  was 
measured.  The  contacts  and  contact  aureole  of  the  intrusive  rocks  were  measured.  Core-
logs were completed at the mine site. 
Appropriate  locations  in the  field  and  selected drill-core,  were  sampled.  The  samples  were 
labelled, bagged and then sent by air freight to the university. At the university the samples 
were  catalogued  and  sent  to  the  SGS  laboratories  in  Booysen,  Johannesburg  for  lapidary. 
These thin sections were studied under refracted light and reflected light microscopy.

Chapter 4: Results 
4.1 Lithologies 
The  lithologies  of  the  FE3  opencasts  (FE3_1,  FE3_2  and  FE3_3)  are  composed  of 
sedimentary  rocks.  The  rocks  can  be  divided  into  four  major  units;  lower  slump  facies,  an 
upper  slump  facies,  a  siltstone-greywacke  and  a  greywacke  unit  (Table  2).  They  are 
unconformably  overlain  by  a  laterite  profile  which  is  a  result  of  post-Palaeoproterozoic 
weathering processes. 
The rocks of the FE3 opencast are deformed, which resulted in the development of breccia 
lodes (cataclasite). The units have been intruded by granodiorite dykes. The intrusions have 
contact metamorphosed the rocks with the development of a contact metamorphic aureole. 
Gold  mineralisation  in  the  breccia  lodes  and  in  the  upper  slump  facies  consists  of 
arsenopyrite-pyrite-gold assemblages. 
4.1.1 Lower slump facies 
The  lower  slump  facies  is  the  lowermost  unit  of  the  study  area  (Map  2  and  3).  It  is 
predominantly  composed  of  siltstone,  with  bedding  trending  south  at  a  dip  of  10°E.  The 
lower slump facies is characterised by turbidite sequences and slump folds (Figs. 5 and 6, 
respectively). 
The lower slump facies is carbonaceous and slump structures are not massive. There are no 
greywacke  beds  in  the  lower  slump  facies.  Slump  features  such  as  glide  surfaces,  chaotic 
folding and detached units are observed in the lower slump facies. 
Boulders  and  cobbles  of  marble,  up  to  10m  and  50cms  in  diameter,  respectively  are 
embedded  in  the  lower  slump  facies.  Towards  the  north  of  FE3_2  open  cast  (Map  2),  the 
marble  boulders  are  generally  massive,  but  in  some  places  bedding  is  preserved.  The 
boulders consist of recrystallised calcite grains but silicification is indicated from crosscutting 
quartz veins (Fig. 7). The marble boulders contain sulphides of pyrite and arsenopyrite (Fig. 
8). 
4.1.2 Upper slump facies 
The  upper  slump  facies  unconformably  overlies  the  upper  slump  facies,  and  it  is 
characterised by slump folds and turbidites sequences. The upper slump facies consists of 
mudstone, siltstone and greywacke beds. The greywacke beds in the upper slump facies are 
20

--- Page 21 ---
dominant  in  FE3_pit  1  and  consist  of  angular  grains  of  quartz  embedded  in  a  fine  grained 
matrix.  The  clasts  range  in  size  from  less  than  0.1  mm  to  about  5mm  diameter.  In  the 
FE3_pit 2 (Map 2), siltstone and mudstone beds with slump folds are dominant. The upper 
slump facies is Fe-rich and has been oxidised. Mudstone dykes are common. The mudstone 
dykes are typically 1cm thick and up to 20 cm long (Fig. 9). The upper slump facies consists 
of  glide  surfaces  (Fig.  10)  and  chaotically  orientated  open  to  isoclinal  to  box,  recumbent, 
overturned or upright folds with various slump fold axes orientations. In places the facies is 
rich  in  carbonate  and  graphite.  Stratigraphic  facing  direction  is  toward  the  NE  as  indicated 
from turbidite beds, fining-upwards, and scour and fill. In general the trend of bedding is SE 
and dip 65°NE.  
Primary  features  observed  in  the  study  area  associated  with  the  slump  structures  include; 
massive sandy sheets, floating clasts, rolled units, inverse grading and mudstone dykes. 
4.1.1 Siltstone-greywacke unit 
The  siltstone-greywacke  sequence  overlies  the  upper  slump  facies.  Facing  has  been 
determined  from  primary  depositional  features  such  as  scour  and  fill,  Bouma  sequences 
(Fig.  11)  and  cross  bedding.  Facing  is  generally  toward  the  NE  throughout  the  opencasts. 
The  unit  is  bedded;  beds  trend  SE  with  an  average  dip  of  20°NE.  Towards  the  north,  in 
FE3_pit 1 there is a cleavage trending NE with an average dip of 35°E.  
The unit is characterised by numerous turbidite beds. Each bed consists of a lower massive 
sand  layer  with  an  erosional  surface  marked  by  mud  clasts.  The  sand  layer  is  overlain  by 
fining-upward  layers  ranging  from  siltstone  to  shale.  The  layers  have  a  thickness  of 
approximately 3cm. 
4.1.5 Greywacke unit 
The  greywacke  unit  unconformably  overlies  the  upper  slump  facies.  The  unit  is  cross-
bedded. The unit is carbonate-bearing and has been metamorphosed to greenschist facies. 
Bedding  trends  to  the  north-west  with  a  dip  of  34°  E.  The  greywacke  consists  of  angular 
grains  of  quartz  embedded  in  a  finer  grained  quartz-chlorite-sericite  matrix.  Stratigraphic 
facing is to the East.  
4.1.6 Laterite profile 
A laterite profile covers the study area to a thickness of more than 2 metres. Laterite is an 
iron-crust  profile  formed  in  humid  tropical  regions  with  contrasting  seasons  (Brown  et  al., 
1994).  During  the  wet  season  iron  is  leached  from  overlying  soils  and  incorporated  into 
21

--- Page 22 ---
minerals at depth, and during the dry season precipitation is intensified by lack of moisture 
(Brown et al., 1994). The laterite profile in the study area consists of goethite and hematite 
aggregates. 
4.2. Granodiorite dykes 
NE–trending  granodiorite  dykes  intrude  the  sedimentary  sequences.  They  consist  of  30% 
and 25% euhedral grains of microcline and orthoclase, respectively. Other minerals include, 
quartz (15%), plagioclase (25%), biotite (<1%) and sericite (4%). The quartz and plagioclase 
crystals  are  subhedral  while  biotite  grains  are  anhedral.  The  granodiorite  is  medium-
crystalline  and  extensively  altered  (Fig.  12).  In  places  the  dykes  have  been  heavily 
weathered leaving a potassium-feldspar-rich residue. The dykes are interpreted to connect 
with  the  Sekokoto  pluton  (Fig.  13),  at  depth  because  the  pluton  underlies  the  Sadiola 
goldfield  (Hein  and  Tshibubudze,  2007a)  as  determined  from  aeromagnetic  data  of  the 
Kenieba Inlier (north sun angle). 
The granodiorite dykes have been extensively altered. The most prominent type of alteration 
is  sericitic  alteration  where  crystals  of  plagioclase,  quartz  and  orthoclase  are  replaced  by 
sericite around the crystal boundary (Fig. 14). Another common alteration in the rocks is a 
deuteric alteration. 
4.3 Structure 
The  rock  units  have  undergone  two  phases  of  deformation.  The  first  deformation  event  is 
mostly  localised  in  the  siltstone-greywacke  unit. This  is  a  deformation  phase  and  indicated 
by a weak shear trending NE with a dip of 60°E.  
The  second  deformation  phase  is  a  regional  extensional  phase.  The  deformation  event 
resulted in the formation of the main structures in the study area. The main structures in the 
FE3 open cast are NW-trending zones of brecciation bounded by faults (Maps 1, 2 and 3). 
The zones consist of faults breccias and cataclasite with an average thickness of 40m. The 
breccia  consists  of  clasts  of  calcite  embedded  in  an  iron-oxide  matrix  (fig.  15).  The  calcite 
clasts are angular in shape and have varying sizes from a few mm’s up to 1m. The breccias 
zones host gold mineralisation.  
4.4 Petrography 
Twenty  three  polished  thin  sections  were  studied  using  reflected  and  transmitted  light 
microscope. The results of the study for each thin section are outlined in the appendices. 
22

--- Page 23 ---
Most  of  the  rock  samples  including  quartzites  and  marble  have  been  recrystallised  and 
metamorphosed.  Quartz  grains  in  the  greywacke  unit  host  stylolitic  micro-textures  and 
granoblastic quartz grains (fig. 16). These textures are interpreted to indicate deformation in 
the rocks. The quartzite has a pinkish potassium feldspar staining. The potassium staining is 
interpreted as an indication of a contact aureole around the rocks. The quartzite is very fine 
grained. 
The marble boulders that occur in the lower slump facies contain pyritohedra (Fig. 8). These 
are  particularly  interesting  as  they  differ  in  shape  and  origin  from  the  ‘normal’  hexagonal 
pyrite. The pyrite grains of this morphology are formed in alkaline polysulphide solutions and 
the  development  of  octahedral  surfaces  are  a  result  of  slow  rate  of  pyritization  and 
crystallisation in the presence of excess CaSO4 (Graham and Ohmoto, 1994).  
The marble is very fine grained and completely composed of calcite. Quartz veins crosscut 
the calcite host rock. Sulphide-rich “micro-veins” cross-cut the host rock and the quartz veins 
(Fig.  7).  Also  the  marble  contains  grains  of  microcline  (Fig.  17).  The  microcline  grains  are 
replaced by the calcite crystal, and this is shown by the jagged edges and the calcite grains 
embedded in microcline. 
The  siltstone-greywacke,  lower  slump  facies,  upper  slump  facies  and  breccias  zones  host 
scorodite.  Scorodite  is  an  alteration  product  of  arsenopyrite,  which  is  formed  under  acidic, 
oxidising  conditions  (Verplanck  et  al.,  2008).  Arsenopyrite  in  the  study  area  is  associated 
with gold mineralisation. In the study area, arsenopyrite has been altered to scorodite. 
The  granodiorite  is  composed  of  plagioclase,  biotite,  sericite,  orthoclase,  quartz,  and 
microcline.  The  plagioclase  is  subhedral,  orthoclase  is  euhedral,  microcline  and  quartz  are 
subhedral and the biotite is anhedral. Sericite is an alteration mineral. The granodiorite has 
been  deuterically  altered  (Fig.  12)  and  sericitised  (Fig.  14).  The  granodiorite  is  medium-
crystalline. It consists of 35% microcline, 20% plagiocase, 20% orthoclase, 20% quartz, 3% 
sericite and 2% biotite. 
4.5 Gold Mineralisation 
There are two phases of mineralisation in the study area; 
1.  Primary hydrothermal mineralisation 
2.  Secondary placer gold mineralisation 
23

--- Page 24 ---
The  primary  gold  mineralisation  occurs  in  the  breccia  zones,  the  lower  slump  facies  and 
also in breccia lodes. The secondary mineralisation occurs in palaeochannels. 
The primary gold mineralisation in the breccia zones occurs in the iron oxide matrix around 
the calcite clasts. In the lower slump facies, the gold mineralisation is hosted by the turbidite 
sequences.  Gold  is  associated  with  sulphides  such  as  arsenopyrite,  pyrrhotite  and  pyrite. 
The  mineralised  zones  occur  in  the  contact  aureole  of  the  granodiorite  dykes  and  are 
associated with hydrothermal alteration. 
Relatively high concentrations of gold are found at the base of palaeochannels in the study 
area. The base of the palaeochannels is marked by an unconformity (Fig. 18). The drainage 
patterns and the morphology of the palaeochannels are controlled by the presence of weak 
zones  such  as  joints  and  fractures.  The  palaeochannels  are  also  developed  along  the 
structural  breccias  zones.  Relatively  smaller  palaeochannels  occur  NE  of  the  FE3 
opencasts  and  these  palaeochannels  drain  into  a  relatively  large  palaeo-river  system  in 
FE3_pit 3 (refer to Map 1, 2 and 3). The drainage system in the south occurs along a wider 
breccias  zone  which  implies  that  the  development  of  the  drainage  system  is  favoured  by 
weaker zones in the rocks. 
The  base  of  these  palaeochannels  has  high  water  content  and  the  mine  has  an  active 
dewatering  program.  This  has  implications  for  mining  and  hydrogeology  such  as  excess 
drainage of water into the mining changes in groundwater movement and storage.

Chapter 5 Discussion 
5.1 Depositional Environment 
Slumps  characterise  the  lower  and  upper  slump  facies.  A  slump  is  a  mass-transported 
debris  flow  (Martinsen,  1994;  Shanmugam,  2000)  along  the  edge  of  a  continental  margin. 
They are a downslope movement of sediment and rock material above a basal shear surface 
where  there  is  significant  internal  distortion  of  the  bedding  (Stow,  1986).  Slump  structures 
form  when  the  sedimentary  pile  abruptly  detaches  from  a  slope  and  is  transported 
downslope (Collinson et al., 1991). A sediment pile will transport downslope when the shear 
stress acting within a body of sediment exceeds the shear strength along the slope surface 
(Dingle, 1980). The sedimentary pile deforms internally (intensely), and produces a variety of 
deformation  structures  such  as  folds,  boudins,  and  micro-faults  (Martinsen,  1994),  all  of 
which are observed in the study area (Fig. 10). 
Ancient  slumps  have  been  reported  in  Country  Clare,  Ireland  and  in  Alexander  Island, 
Antarctica  (Farell,  1984;  Shanmugam,  2000),  and  typically  along  the  edge  of  continental 
margins.  The  slumps  of  Country  Clare  in  Ireland  represent  collapsed  slope  deposits  that 
were laid down on an unstable basin slope (Collinson et al., 1991). The slumps of Alexandra 
Island represent mass transported sediments along dislodged from the continental slope into 
a deep marine environments. Modern slumps are common along continental margins and in 
modern  deltas  (  The  Storegga  slumps  in  Norwegian  continental  margin;  Conway  coast  in 
New  Zealand;  Niger  delta  continental  margin;  Mississippi  delta-front  slumps;  slumps  in  the 
gulf of Mexico) (Shanmugam et al.,1988; Jansen et al., 1987; Damuth, 1993; McConnico et 
al., 2007). Slumping can be triggered by gravity, downslope undercutting, and thickening of 
the  sediment  pile  by  deposition,  slumping  up-slope  or  seismic  activity  (Dingle,  1980; 
Martinsen 1994; Betrand et al., 2008). 
From  this  information  slumps  of  the  upper  and  lower  slump  facies,  which  exhibit  mass 
textures, are interpreted to have formed along a continental margin, possible from a stable 
continental platform 
The  siltstone-greywacke  unit  and  the  upper  slump  facies  are  characterised  by  turbidites 
beds. Turbidites are deposits of turbidity currents (Meyn et al., 1980; Paciullo et al., 2007). 
For Newtonian fluids like water, the criterion for the initiation of turbulence is the Reynolds 
number (Re). The Reynolds number for sediment flow is defined as; 
Re= Ps.U.h/µs 
37

--- Page 38 ---
where Ps= sediment flow density, U= flow mean velocity, h = flow thickness and µs = flow 
apparent viscosity (Sentini, 1970; Nemec, 1990). For turbulence to be initiated the Reynolds 
number must be greater than 2000 (Ercilla et al., 2002). High density, fast flowing and deep-
water environments are favoured for turbidity currents (Quaeño, 2005). Environments such 
as these include deep-water and pro-deltaic environments where turbidite sediments readily 
accumulate (Stow and Johansson 2000; Ponce et al., 2008). From this, it is interpreted that 
the  turbidites  in  the  siltstone-greywacke  and  the  upper  slump  facies  of  the  FE3  opencasts 
were  deposited  in  a  turbulent  environment  with  deposition  in  either  a  pro-deltaic  or  deep-
water environment. 
The  rootless  marble  boulders  described  in  Section  4.1.1  are  interpreted  as  olistoliths 
because  the  boulders  are  embedded  in  slumped  siltstone  units  of  the  Lower  slump  facies. 
An  olistostrome  (composed  of  olistoliths)  is  defined  as  a  sedimentary  body  of  lithological 
heterogeneous  material  in  which  the  fine-grained  matrix  supports  the  clasts  (olistoliths). 
They can result from sliding and debris flow on the edge of the continental margin (Maltman, 
1994; Naylor, 1981). Olistotromes are recorded in Italy and the Niger Delta where slumping 
and  debris  flow  occur  along  the  passive  continental  margin  (Naylor,  1982;  Damuth,  1993). 
This  suggests  that  the  olistostrome  were  formed  along  a  continental  margin  where  debris 
flow and mass transportation displaced blocks and rock material downslope. 
The  mudstone  dykes  in  the  upper  slump  facies  are  similar  to  the  fluid  escape  structures 
described  by  Lowe  (1975),  Stromberg,  (1998)  and  Montenat  et  al.  (2007)  who  interpreted 
mudstone  and  carbonate  dykes  as  injection  dykes  (Fig.  20).  Injection  dykes  are  a  class  of 
seismite  developed  by  soft  sediment  deformation  processes  (Mazumder  et  al.,  2006; 
Montenat  et  al.,  2007).  They  are  caused  by  seismic  shocks  commonly  induced  by 
earthquakes  and  form  as  a  result  of  hydrofracturing  and  fluidisation.  (Fuller,  1912  in 
Montenat et al., 2007). A fracture network is formed in relatively cohesive sediment during a 
seismic  event  and  soft  sediments,  such  as  mud,  percolate  into  the  fracture  network 
(Montenat et al., 2007; Foix et al., 2008). It is possible that the mudstone dykes in the upper 
slump facies of the FE3 opencasts formed seismically active environment. 
Shanmugam  (1997)  also  proposed  a  non-seismic  model  for  the  formation  of  fluid  escape 
structures.  The  fluid  escape  structures  are  a  feature  of  rapid  sedimentation  (Shanmugam, 
1997;  2000)  and  gravity  induced  sliding  (Collinson  et  al,  1991).  When  sediments  are 
deposited  at  a  relatively  fast  rate,  fluid  is  trapped  within  the  sediments,  such  that  the 
sediments are suspended in fluid (Foix et al., 2008). The grains settle into a grain framework 
38

--- Page 39 ---
and  as  a  result  the  fluid  trapped  in  the  sediments  is  squeezed  through  the  pore  space 
network (Lowe, 1975). Fluid escapes by percolating upwards through the sediments and the 
vein  network  represents  the  pathways  along  which  the  fluid  movement  occurred  (Lowe, 
1975). Therefore, it may also be possible that the fluid escape structures formed in a gravity-
induced slump environment. 
The contact between the upper slump facies and the greywacke unit represents a change in 
depositional environment. Because of limited outcrop exposure and deep weathering it is not 
well  exposed  but  must  represent  an  unconformity  (sensu  stricto).  In  the  nearby  Sadiola 
opencast (6 kms west) the greywacke unit is massive, laminated and crossbedded (Hein et 
al..,  2008),  with  no  evidence  of  slump  or  debris  flows.  It  is  interpreted  to  have  been 
deposited  in  a  shallow  marine  tidal  environment.  The  greywacke  unit  at  the  FE3  opencast 
thus  represents  a  change  in  depositional  environment  towards  shallow  marine  tidal.  The 
unconformity therefore represents a drop in sea level or regression along the delta, or uplift.  
In  summary,  slumps  in  the  upper  and  lower  slump  facies  indicate  that  there  was  mass 
transportation,  slumping  and  debris  flow  along  a  (possible)  continental  margin  during 
deposition.  Turbidites  units  in  the  upper  slump  facies  and  siltstone-greywacke  unit  were 
deposited in turbulent environment, possibly in pro-deltaic or deep-water environment. The 
mudstone dykes of the upper slump facies are interpreted to represent a class of seismites 
called sedimentary injection dykes which are formed in a seismically active environment or 
under gravity-induced collapse. Seismic activity or gravity-induced collapse is interpreted as 
the  triggering  mechanism  for  mass  transport  and  debris  flow.  The  greywacke  unit 
unconformably  overlying  the  siltstone-greywacke  is  interpreted  to  represent  a  significant 
change in depositional environment following the deposition of the siltstone-greywacke unit. 
Further  to  this,  the  marble  boulders  embedded  in  the  lower  slump  facies  host  cube-
pyritohedrons  with  relict  pyrrhotite  (Fig.  8).  Experimental  studies  on  the  morphology  of 
pyrites by Graham and Ohmoto (1994) demonstrated that the growth of octahedral pyrite (on 
pyrrhotite  surfaces)  requires  the  presence  of  excess  CaSO4  (gypsum)  leading  to  the 
possibility that CaSO4 (gypsum) was found in excess in the provenance environment of the 
boulders. If correct the source region for the marble may have been an evaporatic shallow 
marine  environment  (Schröder  et  al.,  2006).  Also  marble  is  a  metamorphic  rock  and  the 
pyritohedrons  are  the  product  of  recrystallization.  This  indicates  the  provenance  area  of 
marble was subjected to metamorphism. 
39

--- Page 40 ---
The deposition of carbonate occurs in a relative stable depositional environment (Proyer et 
al.,  2008).  Slope  and  shallow  marine  carbonate  can  be  re-sedimented  into  a  slump 
environment  by  the  processes  of  debris  fall  and  sliding  as  olistoliths  (Naylor,  1982; 
Martinsen, 1994). Debris fall and flow are common processes along the pro-delta (Manzi et 
al.,  2007;  Pierre  et  al.,  2006;  Dennielou  et  al.,  2006).  Debris  flow  of  a  carbonate  platform 
requires  a  triggering  mechanism  that  destabilizes  the  environment  to  form  olistostrome. 
Debris flow can be triggered by gravity, active earthquakes or seismic shocks (Montenat et 
al., 2007; McConnico et al., 2007; Damuth, 1993). In this case, the marble olistoliths in the 
FE3 opencasts were re-sedimented into a slump environment by debris flow and slumping 
along a continental margin. 
Finally,  the  sediments  of  the  FE3  opencasts  (Kofi  Series)  have  not  been  dated  but  are 
interpreted as Birimian in age by Hirdes et al. (2002). The Birimian sequences of the West 
African  craton  are  dated  at  2238-2171  Ma  (Milési  et  al.,  1991,  1992;  Ledru  et  al.,  1991; 
Boher  et  al.,  1992).  The  Birimian  sequences  are  composed  of  tholeiitic  basalts,  andesitic 
volcanic,  calc-alkaline  volcanics,  volcaniclastic  sediments,  detrital  sediments  and  chemical 
sediments which are characteristic of an oceanic island arc environment (Hirdes et al., 2002; 
Gueye  et  al.,  2008).  In  contrast,  the  Birimian  sequences  of  the  Keniéba  Inlier  (i.e.,  Mako 
Supergroup;  Diale-Daleme  Supergroup;  Falemé  volcanic  belt)  are  dated  at  2063±41  Ma, 
2096±8  Ma  +  2099±4  Ma  (respectively).  They  are  interpreted  as  remnants  of  an  oceanic 
island  arcs  terrane  that  was  accreted  onto  an  Archaean  continent  (Diallo,  2001;  Dia  et  al., 
1997).  There  is  a  considerable  difference  between  the  ages  given  for  the  Birimian 
sequences of the West African craton and those of the Kenieba Inlier as indicated in Fig 22 
and accord better, but are still younger, than those of the Tarkwa Group (2149-2132 Ma; U-
Pb  zircon,  Davis  et  al.,  1994)  which  unconformably  overlies  the  Birimian.  It  is  therefore 
suggested  that  the  slump,  olistostrome,  turbidite,  siltstone-greywacke  and  greywacke 
sediments of the FE3 opencasts were derived from the erosion of the Birimian terrane. 
5.2 Gold bearing breccias and veins 
The  structures  that  host  mineralisation  in  the  region  are  breccia  and  quartz-arsenopyrite 
veins that crosscut the stratigraphy, which implies that gold mineralisation is younger than 
the  sedimentary  units.  The  mineralised  breccias  (and  associated  alteration,  Fig.  21)  occur 
around contact aureole of the granodiorite. This may imply that the mineralisation is related 
to the intrusion of the granodiorite as has been established in the nearby Sadiola deposit by 
Hein and Tshibubudze (2007b). The granodiorite dykes show evidence of fluid circulation as 
represented  by  deuteric  alteration  and  sericitisation.  Similar  deuteric  alteration  and 
sericitisation textures have been reported by Candela (1994) and Yuguchi et al. (2007) and

may be the result of dissolution and re-precipitation related to fluid movement. This suggest 
that there was fluid circulation associated with the granodiorite however is not clear whether 
the fluids are contact metamorphic or magmatic.  
The  Kéniéba  Inlier  was  intruded  by  granitoids  during  the  Eburnean  Orogeny.  Two  major 
magmatic  events  have  been  identified  in  the  Inlier;  at  2.16-2.11  Ga  and  at  2.08-2.07  Ga 
(Gueye et al., 2008).  
5.3 Secondary placer gold mineralisation 
Placer  gold  mineralisation 
is  hosted  at 
the  base  of 
the  palaeochannels.  These 
palaeochannel crosscut the mineralised breccias and the lower slump facies. This suggests 
that the palaeochannels are younger than the primary mineralised zones. The source of the 
gold  is  interpreted  to  be  derived  from  the  erosion  the  primary  hydrothermal  gold 
mineralisation.  
5.4 Geological history 
The geological history of the FE3 open cast: - 
1.  Deposition of the lower slump facies. 
2.  Deposition of the upper slump facies 
3.  Deposition of the siltstone-greywacke unit. 
4.  Erosion followed by the deposition of the greywacke unit during marine regression or 
uplift. 
5.  Development of a weak shear localised in the Siltstone-Greywacke unit.  
6.  Intrusion  of  the  granodiorite  dykes  and  the  Sekokoto  pluton.  The  intrusion  was 
accompanied by contact metamorphism around the intrusive rocks. Also the intrusion 
resulted  in  the  circulation  of  magmatic-hydrothermal  fluids  in  the  sedimentary 
sequences and in the dykes. Gold-bearing breccias possibly formed at this time. 
7.  Erosion  and  the  development  of  the  palaeochannels  and  deposition  of  the  placer 
gold mineralisation. 
8.  Erosion and development of the laterite profile.

6. Conclusions 
1. 
The lithologies of the FE3 opencasts (FE3_1, FE3_2 and FE3_3) can be divided into 
four major units; lower slump facies, an upper slump facies, a siltstone-greywacke and 
a greywacke unit.  
2. 
Slumps  of  the  upper  and  lower  slump  facies,  which  exhibit  mass  flow  textures  (glide 
surfaces,  slump  folds,  chaotic  bedding,  floating  clast,  olistoliths,  turbidites,  seismites 
and fluid escape structures) are interpreted to have formed along a continental margin 
in  either  a  pro-deltaic  or  deep-water  environment,  possible  from  a  stable  continental 
platform. 
3.  Olistoliths  (marble,  mudstone,  etc)  embedded  in  slumped  siltstone  units  of  the  Lower 
Slump  facies  are  were  the  result  of  mass  transport  of  carbonate  blocks  and  rock 
material  downslope  from  a  stable  carbonate  platform.  Pyritohedrons  in  marble 
olistoliths may indicate an evaporatic shallow marine environment. 
4.  Mudstone  dykes  are  common  in  the  upper  slump  facies.  The  dykes  were  possibly 
produced by seismic activity or gravity-induced collapse. 
5. 
6. 
A siltstone-greywacke sequence overlies the upper slump facies is crossbedded.  
The  contact  between  the  upper  slump  facies  and  the  greywacke  unit  represents  a 
change in depositional environment marked by a drop in sea level or regression along 
the delta, or uplift. 
7. 
The  above  stratigraphy  has  been  intruded  by  granodiorite  dykes  that  are  deuterically 
altered and sericitised.  
8. 
There  are  two  phases  of  mineralisation  in  the  study  area.  (a)  Primary  hydrothermal 
mineralisation: Gold mineralisation in the breccia lodes and in the upper slump facies 
consists  of  arsenopyrite-pyrite-gold  assemblages; 
(b)  Secondary  placer  gold 
mineralisation.  
9. 
A laterite profile covers the study area to a thickness of more than 2 metres 
10.  The considerable difference between the ages given for the Birimian sequences of the 
West  African  craton  and  those  of  the  Kenieba  Inlier  could  indicate  that  the  slump, 
olistostrome,  turbidite,  siltstone-greywacke  and  greywacke  sediments  of  the  FE3 
opencasts were derived from the erosion of the Birimian terrane.
