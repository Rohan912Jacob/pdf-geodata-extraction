Architecture and geological setting of southern Mali and northeast Guinea  The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed  sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic  rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || The  basin  is  composed  of  shale,  sandstone,  greywacke,  and  intercalated  volcano-sedimentary  rocks  (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Parker and Wilkinson, 2011). The NW-trending Bougouni belt (Figure 2.2) of  Girard et al. (1998) and Randgold (2008) is situated in the southeast of the Bougouni basin. The NE- trending Massigui belt of Girard et al. (1998) is situated in the NE of the basin and is composed of  porphyry rhyodacites with basalt, breccia and conglomerate units (Kušnir, 1989; Girard et al., 1998). The Banifing shear zone separates the Bougouni basin to the west from the Bagoé basin to the  east (Figure 2.4). || The  Kadiana-Manankoro  greenstone  belt  is  the  eastern  boundary  of  the  Bagoé  basin. It  is  represented by a contact that is faulted with gneissic rocks (Girard et al., 1998). Metamorphism in the study zone is characterised by regional and contact metamorphic mineral  assemblages. Regional  metamorphism  is  characterised  by  mineral  assemblages  to  middle  to  upper  greenschist mineral assemblage (Tunks et al., 2004). Contact  metamorphism is characterised by the  amphibolite facies observed in the contact aureole of granitoids. 2.6.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Bagoe, Karrantza Harana/Valle de Carranza, Biscay, Autonomous Community of the Basque Country, 48891, Spain<br><b>Pages:</b> 16,17<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The Yanfolila fault to the west of the Yanfolila belt is arcuate and dips steeply west. 5. The Banifing shear zone is also characterised by parallel shear trends. A number of southeast  trending splay shears are also evident. The shears bound high susceptibility rock volumes that  internal to the Banifing shear zone form right handed (clockwise) sigmoids that are consistent  with dextral displacement in the plane of the shear zone, respectively. || According  to  the  petrophysical  measurements  of  surface  rocks  (WAXI,  2013)  lithologies  include  granitoid  gneiss,  various  metasedimentary  rocks,  feldspathic  sand,  and pegmatite  veins. The  low  susceptibility  of  the  zone 5  model is related to sedimentary cover. The  zone  5  is  composed  of  low  to  high  susceptibility  and  the  low  density  volumes,  that  trend  north to northeast. Some rock volumes are arcuate in shape (Figure 5.20). Northeasterly and north-northeasterly trending rocks volumes dominate the centre and east of the  zone 5 model and correspond to high magnetic susceptibility values in and adjacent to the Banifing  shear zone (Figure 5.20).

Bodies 2 and 4 report low susceptibility and are  interpreted as splay shears of the Banifing shear zone. Bodies 3, 5 and 6 report a high susceptibility. The profile resolves similarities between bodies 3, 5 and 6 in term of parameters (dip, top depth  and depth projection) (Table 5.1). The bodies 2 and 4  are  similar in parameters,  and different  from  body  1. However,  bodies  2,  3,  4,  5,  6  are  located  in  the  Banifing  shear  zone. || According to the magnetic susceptibility and density, bodies 2, 3 and 5 are different from bodies  1 and 4, reflecting different rock types.

The  bodies  2,  3  and  5  correspond with the Banifing shear zone and are possibly west-dipping splay shears. Consequently the  Banifing  shear  zone  is  interpreted  as  complex  structure.

Additionally, a high density high susceptibility zone is located in the  northwest corner of zone 4 which could be related to gneissic rocks in the Bougouni belt. The inversion sections from magnetic and gravity data of zone 4 are presented in Figures 5.17- 5.18. In Figure 5.17, northwest trending rock volumes in Bougouni belt dip sub-vertically to steeply  west, while north trending rock volumes trending dip steeply east. In contrast, northeast trending rock volumes in the region of the Banifing shear zone dip steeply  east and are bound by it and secondary splay shears that trend north to north-northeasterly. According  to  the  inversion  sections,  the  Banifing  shear  zone  is  characterised  by  low  density  and  low  susceptibility which could be due to the volcaniclastic sediments in the region because *****. || Consequently,  the  Banifing  shear  zone  can  be  considered  as  a  complex  structure  formed  by  a  main  shear  and  several  secondary splay shears that resolve differences in dip and trend. 5.2.4. Synthesis of forward modelling  The forward modelling of the three transects shows that:  1. Transect  1  crosscuts  the  Yanfolila  shear  zone  and  resolves  its  complexity. The  trends  are  subvertical  to  east-dipping  for  body  3,  and  east-dipping  for  bodies  2  and  3;  they  are  interpreted  as  42 || Geological synthesis of inverse modelling   Inverse modelling was performed on the two first-order crustal-scale structures, namely, the  Yanfolila shear zone and Banifing shear zone. The inversions modelling resolved the geometry of the  shear zone geometries using the surface petrophysical and fact data available. The inversion showed:-   1. There is a difference in thicknesses of sedimentary cover at approximately 1200m for the  Yanfolila shear zone and approximately 700m for Banifing shear zone. 2. First-order scale shear zones are steeply dipping to the west or east and are complex  structures, with numerous second order splay shear. || Key zone 4 is located in the southeast of  the  study  area  on  the  Banifing  shear  zone  (Figure  4.13).

The NW-trending Bougouni belt (Figure 2.2) of  Girard et al. (1998) and Randgold (2008) is situated in the southeast of the Bougouni basin. The NE- trending Massigui belt of Girard et al. (1998) is situated in the NE of the basin and is composed of  porphyry rhyodacites with basalt, breccia and conglomerate units (Kušnir, 1989; Girard et al., 1998). The Banifing shear zone separates the Bougouni basin to the west from the Bagoé basin to the  east (Figure 2.4). || The  Kadiola  Shear  Zone  was  highlighted  with  the  AGC  map. On  the  Figure  4.11  the  intersection between dykes and others features were also confirmed. The  AGC  of  Bouguer  anomaly  is  presented  in  Figure  4.12. The  Figure  4.12  enable  the  identification  of  some  of  this  image  presents  the  same  features  presented  with  the  first  vertical  derivative  of  Bouguer  anomalies  (Figure  4.6). The  AGC  of  Bouguer  anomalies  enabled  the  confirmation  of  Bouguer  anomalies  first  vertical  derivative  maps  attributes  (Figure  4.6). The  NW  trending Menankoto Fault (Figure 4.12) crosscuts the Yanfolila-Kalana and Banifing shear zone and  is thus younger in relative age. || The magnetic and gravity inversion sections of model 5 are presented in Figures 5.21-5.22. The  inversion  sections demonstrate that  the Banifing  shear  zone is steeply  dipping to  the  west  and  east. According to the magnetic section, the rock volumes are located at approximately 500-700m depth. According to gravity sections (Figure 5.22), high density rocks are located in the northern part of  model  5  at  depth;  they  are  not  crosscut  by  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  may  represent  younger  intrusions. A high density region in the northwest of zone 5 in the Kolondieba belt could be due to the  basalt and gneiss. 5.3.6. || The parameters of the east-west trending dyke that crosscuts zone 4 are presented in Figure 5.19  with sections. From this data the dyke dips steeply to north to vertical. Thick sedimentary cover above  the dyke is attributed to low susceptibility values at surface. 5.3.5. Key Zone 5  The inversion of key zone 5 is presented in Figure 5.20. Key zone 5 is located in the central east  of the study area on the widest part of the Banifing shear zone and includes the Madina fault and the  southern  extension  of  the  Kolondieba  belt  (Figure  4.13). || The rocks types are likely to be siltstone, shale and/or volcaniclastic sediments. 5.3. Inverse modelling  The  inversion  was  performed  on  six  (6)  key  zones  according  to  high  levels  of  confidence  established in Table 4.1, and available fact and petrophysical data (Figure 4.17). The location of the  key  zones  is  presented  in  Figure  ***  and  are  situated  on  the  first-order  crustal  scale  Yanfolila  and  Banifing  shear  zones,  and  certain  second-order  structures  and  dykes  (Figure  5.6). The  selection  of  second-order  structures  was  based  on  proximity  to  the  first-order  crustal  scale  structures. The  inversions were performed using magnetic and gravity data in addition to the forward modelling of  transects to produce a consistence model of the selected zone. || This may suggest folding of the rock units they represent. Two areas of high densities are resolved in the zone 5 inversion model (Figure 5.20). Area 1 is  located  in  the  Kolondieba  belt,  where  the  high  density  coincides  to  the  high  susceptibility. The  coincidence of high susceptibility and high density corresponds to gneissic rocks identified with the  surface  rock  petrophysics  measurements. Area  2  is  located  in  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  is  also  interpreted as a gneissic rock volume. 46 || This was established  by Wijns (2009) in a comparative study between the magnetic and electromagnetic methods as used in  the Syama belt. His work showed that intrusive bodies, which are indistinct in the magnetic data, are  readily resolved from electromagnetic data. The host rocks in the Syama belt are highly conductive  because of graphite in the host rocks, relative to the intrusive bodies which are less conductive. Furthermore, a study completed by Féménias (2008) of the Banifing shear zone highlighted that  basement  rock  lineaments  are  well  resolved  in  the  magnetic  and  radiometric  airborne  geophysical  datasets. A  limitation  to  interpreting  magnetic  data  is  the  fact  that  laterite-ferricrete  covers  a  significant  portion of the study area and major parts of the Baoulé-Mossi domain (Brown et al., 1994; Blot, 2004;  Beauvais  et  al.,  2008). The  presence  of  laterite-ferricrete  can  complicate  the  magnetic  data  presentation  and  affect  interpretations,  but  by  applying  linear  filters  the  effects  of  laterite-ferricrete  can be minimised in the magnetic signature. || splay shears to the main Yanfolila shear zone. The Yanfolila shear zone crosscuts the Yanfolila belt  according to the similarity of bodies 1 and 6. The Kalana-Kodieran fold also is identified in transect 1. 2. Transect  2  and  3  is  located  to  the  Banifing  shear  zone  which  is  also  a  complex  structure  composed of several shear trends and secondary splay shears. The  forward  modelling of three profiles  across the Yanfolila  and Banifing shear  zones (Figure  4.13) facilitated the characterization and geometry of the first-order structures, in terms of trend and  dip. ||   Domain 2 - A northeast to east domain that is characterized by moderate magnetic mineral  content  and  moderate  to  high  density  mineral. It  possible  to  identify  the  NE  trending  Banifing, Fatou and Syama shear zones, and approximately EW trending dykes (Figure 4.5).   Domain 3 - A domain located between the southeast domain, and northeast to east domain  that is characterized by  moderate magnetic mineral content and moderate intensity gravity  signature. The first vertical derivative of TMI enabled the identification of Yanfolila-Kalana  shear zone; Yanfolila belt and Kalana-Kodiaran fold (Figure 4.5).   Domain 4 - A northwest domain that is characterized by low magnetic mineral content and  high intensity gravity zone. This domain includes the Yanfolila Fault and Siguiri Shear Zone  (Figure 4.5). ||   Farako  Fault  which  trends  NE  and  crosscut  the  Banifing  and  Fatou  shear  zones,  and  Bougouni belt. The NW trend highlighted with the first derivative map of Bouguer anomalies is confirmed by  Menankoro Fault (Figure 4.6). Furthermore,  Figure  4.8  enabled  enhancement  of  as  series  EW  trending  lineaments  that  were  extracted from the Upward Continuation of the TMI (Figure 4.3), Magnetic First Vertical Derivative  (Figure 4.5) and Analytical Signal (Figure 4.7), and interpreted as dykes.

His work showed that intrusive bodies, which are indistinct in the magnetic data, are  readily resolved from electromagnetic data. The host rocks in the Syama belt are highly conductive  because of graphite in the host rocks, relative to the intrusive bodies which are less conductive. Furthermore, a study completed by Féménias (2008) of the Banifing shear zone highlighted that  basement  rock  lineaments  are  well  resolved  in  the  magnetic  and  radiometric  airborne  geophysical  datasets.

Architecture and geological setting of southern Mali and northeast Guinea  The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed  sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic  rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || Syama belt at Syama can be divided into sedimentary sequences of the Tarkwa Group in the east, and  volcano-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  to  the  west  (Girard  et  al.,  1998). The  NNE  trending Syama Shear Zone crosscuts the Syama belt (Standing, 2006). The structures that predominate in the study area include first-order scale crustal shear zones, and  second-order shears, faults and folds. The Siguiri basin is dominated by north to NNE trending dextral  strike-slip shear zones (Steyn, 2012), and a second order scale WNW trending faults. The Yanfolila  belt is dominated by the northerly trending Yanfolila Shear Zone (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Randgold,  2008; Miller et al., 2013). The eastern margin of the Bougouni basin is bounded by the Banifing Shear  Zone. || The  basin  is  composed  of  shale,  sandstone,  greywacke,  and  intercalated  volcano-sedimentary  rocks  (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Parker and Wilkinson, 2011). The NW-trending Bougouni belt (Figure 2.2) of  Girard et al. (1998) and Randgold (2008) is situated in the southeast of the Bougouni basin. The NE- trending Massigui belt of Girard et al. (1998) is situated in the NE of the basin and is composed of  porphyry rhyodacites with basalt, breccia and conglomerate units (Kušnir, 1989; Girard et al., 1998). The Banifing shear zone separates the Bougouni basin to the west from the Bagoé basin to the  east (Figure 2.4).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Bougouni, Bougouni Cercle, Sikasso Region, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 16,17<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  Yanfolila  belt  is  the  northwest-trending  extension  in  Mali  of  the  Ziemougoula  volcano- sedimentary belt in Guinea and the Ivory Coast (Figure 2.2). The Yanfolila belt and several outliers  are composed of massive mafic volcanic rock (Girard et al., 1998; Parker and Wilkinson, 2011). The  Yanfolila  belt  is  crosscut  by  the  northerly  trending  Yanfolila  shear  zone  in  Figure  2.2  (Randgold,  2008) which separates the Siguiri basin from the Bougouni Basin. The  Bougouni  basin  (locally  called  the  Bougouni-Kerekoro  basin)  is  situated  between  the  Yanfolila  and  Banifing  shear  zones  (Figure  2.2  and  2.3). The  basin  is  intruded  by  a  TTG  suite  batholith located in the centre and north and granite plutons (Girard et al., 1998, Miller, 2013). || The northwest trending Bagoe volcano-sedimentary belt is the western extension of  the Bondiali-Bagoé-Diaoula belt in Ivory Coast which splits to form the Bagoé volcano-sedimentary  belt  and the Banfora belt  (Bessoles, 1977). The Bagoé  belt has  been  subdivided  into Syama  belt  at  Syama (Girard et al., 1998), and the Kadiana-Madinani domain to the west of the Syama Shear Zone  and the Kadiolo domain to the east of the Syama Shear (Standing, 2000). The  Kadiana-Madinani  domain  is  interpreted  by  Bentley  et  al.

The  low  susceptibility  of  the  zone 5  model is related to sedimentary cover. The  zone  5  is  composed  of  low  to  high  susceptibility  and  the  low  density  volumes,  that  trend  north to northeast. Some rock volumes are arcuate in shape (Figure 5.20). Northeasterly and north-northeasterly trending rocks volumes dominate the centre and east of the  zone 5 model and correspond to high magnetic susceptibility values in and adjacent to the Banifing  shear zone (Figure 5.20). The overall shear trend can be defined as northeasterly but internal north- northeast  trending  rock  volumes  form  right-handed  (clockwise)  sigmoids  that  are  consistent  with  dextral displacement in the plane of the Banifing shear zone  Northerly trending rocks volumes occur in the Kolondieba belt in the west of zone 5, and in the  east and are arcuate in form. || Application of vertical integral on the analytical signal  The image presented in Figure 4.8 is the application of vertical integral on the analytical signal  map. The attributes extracted from Figure 4.8 coincide with those extracted from the analytical signal  map in Figure 4.7 but were more enhanced. The Figure 4.8 enabled the identification of:    NE, north and NNW trending lineaments that made up the Yanfolila belt. These lineaments  could be the lithological trends of Yanfolila belt.   The Bougouni belt presents a NW trend with magmatic intrusion around.   The Kolondieba belt (Randgold, 2007). || The automatic gain control (AGC)  The  automatic  gain  control  of  the  total  magnetic  field  is  presented  in  Figure  4.11. The  Figure  4.11 allowed the enhancement of signal that can highlight the volcano-sedimentary belts underlined  with images (Figure 4.5, 4.7 and 4.8). But the difference in this image is the fact that it presents the  connexion  between  Bougouni  belt  and  Kolondieba  belt  (Figure  4.11). The  Figure  4.11  enabled  the  identification of others stretch features in white colour (Figure 4.11), trending NE. The automatic gain  control  enhances  these  feature  (Figure  4.11)  compare  to  Figure  4.5,  4.7  and  4.8. The  Figure  4.11  allowed the enhancement of Yanfolila and Madina Faults, the Yanfolila- Kalana and Banifing Shear  Zone. || The magnetic and gravity inversion sections of model 5 are presented in Figures 5.21-5.22. The  inversion  sections demonstrate that  the Banifing  shear  zone is steeply  dipping to  the  west  and  east. According to the magnetic section, the rock volumes are located at approximately 500-700m depth. According to gravity sections (Figure 5.22), high density rocks are located in the northern part of  model  5  at  depth;  they  are  not  crosscut  by  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  may  represent  younger  intrusions. A high density region in the northwest of zone 5 in the Kolondieba belt could be due to the  basalt and gneiss. 5.3.6. || The parameters of the east-west trending dyke that crosscuts zone 4 are presented in Figure 5.19  with sections. From this data the dyke dips steeply to north to vertical. Thick sedimentary cover above  the dyke is attributed to low susceptibility values at surface. 5.3.5. Key Zone 5  The inversion of key zone 5 is presented in Figure 5.20. Key zone 5 is located in the central east  of the study area on the widest part of the Banifing shear zone and includes the Madina fault and the  southern  extension  of  the  Kolondieba  belt  (Figure  4.13). || These  extensive  anomalies  trend  NNW  and NW  (Figure  4.5) and correspond with:    The  Yanfolila  belt  that  trends  NNW  and  is  located  west  of  Yanfolila-Kalana  Shear  Zone  (Girard et al., 1998).   The Bougouni belt that trends NW and is located to the southwest of BSZ (Randgold, 2007).   The Kolondieba belt which is located to the west  of the BSZ and north of Bougouni belt,  and  trends  NW. The  belt  was  identified  by  Randgold  (2007)  who  described  its  volcano- sedimentary character. A number of curvilinear attributes in the study area can be interpreted as folds  (Figure 4.5), and  correspond with folds interpreted by Feybesse et al. (2006). || This may suggest folding of the rock units they represent. Two areas of high densities are resolved in the zone 5 inversion model (Figure 5.20). Area 1 is  located  in  the  Kolondieba  belt,  where  the  high  density  coincides  to  the  high  susceptibility. The  coincidence of high susceptibility and high density corresponds to gneissic rocks identified with the  surface  rock  petrophysics  measurements. Area  2  is  located  in  the  Banifing  shear  zone  and  is  also  interpreted as a gneissic rock volume. 46 ||   The  Madina  Fault  trends  NE. It  crosscuts  the  Kalana-Kodiaran  fold,  Bougouni  and  Kolondieba belt and Banifing Shear Zone.   The Menankoro Fault  which  crosscuts the Banifing and Yanfolila-Kalana Shear Zone,  the  Bougouni belt, Mandiana-Yanfolila and Madina Fault. This fault is a NW trending.   The  Kadiolo-Fourou Fault which trends NW  and crosscuts  the Kadiolo, Syama  and Fatou  Shear Zone.   The Koumatou Morila Fault which trends NW and crosscuts the Banifing and Fatou Shear  Zone. ||   Transect 2 (BB’) from GPS coordinates 687510E and 1164475N to 721944E and 1164475N,  and  measures  approximately  34km  in  length. It  transects  the  Bougouni  belt,  Banifing  shear  zone and Menankoro fault in the southeastern region of the study area (Figure 4.13).   Transect  3  (CC’)  extends  from  GPS  coordinates  704880E  and  1232696N  to  751630E  and  1232696N,  and  measures  approximately  47km  in  length. It  transects  the  Kolondieba  belt,  Madina fault, and Banifing shear zone in the east central region of the study area (Figure 4.13). A profile of the upward continuation of magnetic data was calculated for each transect to produce  three  profiles  (Profile  1-3). The  magnetic  susceptibility  data  used  published  petrophysical  data  to  calculate the magnetic field. || These  extensive  anomalies  trend  NNW  and NW  (Figure  4.5) and correspond with:    The  Yanfolila  belt  that  trends  NNW  and  is  located  west  of  Yanfolila-Kalana  Shear  Zone  (Girard et al., 1998).   The Bougouni belt that trends NW and is located to the southwest of BSZ (Randgold, 2007).   The Kolondieba belt which is located to the west  of the BSZ and north of Bougouni belt,  and  trends  NW.

Architecture and geological setting of southern Mali and northeast Guinea  The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed  sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic  rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || Syama belt at Syama can be divided into sedimentary sequences of the Tarkwa Group in the east, and  volcano-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  to  the  west  (Girard  et  al.,  1998). The  NNE  trending Syama Shear Zone crosscuts the Syama belt (Standing, 2006). The structures that predominate in the study area include first-order scale crustal shear zones, and  second-order shears, faults and folds. The Siguiri basin is dominated by north to NNE trending dextral  strike-slip shear zones (Steyn, 2012), and a second order scale WNW trending faults. The Yanfolila  belt is dominated by the northerly trending Yanfolila Shear Zone (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Randgold,  2008; Miller et al., 2013). The eastern margin of the Bougouni basin is bounded by the Banifing Shear  Zone. || The  basin  is  bordered  by  the  Yanfolila  granites  in  Mali (Figure 2.3). The  Yanfolila  belt  is  the  northwest-trending  extension  in  Mali  of  the  Ziemougoula  volcano- sedimentary belt in Guinea and the Ivory Coast (Figure 2.2).

Architecture and geological setting of southern Mali and northeast Guinea  The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed  sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic  rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || 4. Electromagnetic data were acquired by SAGAX Afrique specifically for use in the project. The data  was  collected  as  part  of  the  SYSMIN  project,  with  surveys  conducted  in  2002  by  the  FUGRO  Airborne Survey Pty  Ltd. The  electromagnetic (EM)  data  available  covers only  two portions of  the  study area:  the Yanfolila volcano-sedimentary belt and the Syama belt (Figure 2.1). 5. Geological data was taken from public domain company technical reports, research work, and the  SYSMIN project. || Syama belt at Syama can be divided into sedimentary sequences of the Tarkwa Group in the east, and  volcano-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  to  the  west  (Girard  et  al.,  1998). The  NNE  trending Syama Shear Zone crosscuts the Syama belt (Standing, 2006). The structures that predominate in the study area include first-order scale crustal shear zones, and  second-order shears, faults and folds. The Siguiri basin is dominated by north to NNE trending dextral  strike-slip shear zones (Steyn, 2012), and a second order scale WNW trending faults. The Yanfolila  belt is dominated by the northerly trending Yanfolila Shear Zone (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Randgold,  2008; Miller et al., 2013). The eastern margin of the Bougouni basin is bounded by the Banifing Shear  Zone. || The northwest trending Bagoe volcano-sedimentary belt is the western extension of  the Bondiali-Bagoé-Diaoula belt in Ivory Coast which splits to form the Bagoé volcano-sedimentary  belt  and the Banfora belt  (Bessoles, 1977). The Bagoé  belt has  been  subdivided  into Syama  belt  at  Syama (Girard et al., 1998), and the Kadiana-Madinani domain to the west of the Syama Shear Zone  and the Kadiolo domain to the east of the Syama Shear (Standing, 2000). The  Kadiana-Madinani  domain  is  interpreted  by  Bentley  et  al. (2000)  as  a  back-arc  basin  that  was accreted onto the Kadiolo terrane during the peak of the Eburnean orogeny (ca. 2.2-2.0 Ga). The  19 || This was established  by Wijns (2009) in a comparative study between the magnetic and electromagnetic methods as used in  the Syama belt. His work showed that intrusive bodies, which are indistinct in the magnetic data, are  readily resolved from electromagnetic data. The host rocks in the Syama belt are highly conductive  because of graphite in the host rocks, relative to the intrusive bodies which are less conductive. Furthermore, a study completed by Féménias (2008) of the Banifing shear zone highlighted that  basement  rock  lineaments  are  well  resolved  in  the  magnetic  and  radiometric  airborne  geophysical  datasets. A  limitation  to  interpreting  magnetic  data  is  the  fact  that  laterite-ferricrete  covers  a  significant  portion of the study area and major parts of the Baoulé-Mossi domain (Brown et al., 1994; Blot, 2004;  Beauvais  et  al.,  2008). The  presence  of  laterite-ferricrete  can  complicate  the  magnetic  data  presentation  and  affect  interpretations,  but  by  applying  linear  filters  the  effects  of  laterite-ferricrete  can be minimised in the magnetic signature.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Syama, Kadiolo Cercle, Sikasso Region, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 16,17,19,37<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Taoudeni Basin, Hodh Ech Chargui, Mauritania<br><b>Pages:</b> 13,16<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Architecture and geological setting of southern Mali and northeast Guinea  The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed  sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic  rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002). || 4.2.9. The potassium map  The Figure  4.14 corresponds to the potassium  map of the study area. This image was used for  comparison with attributes extracted from geophysical maps (Figure 4.13) to establish the confidence  level of the study area. According to the similarity between Figure 4.14 with attribute maps (Figure  4.13) the attributes that can be highlighted includes:    The Yanfolila, Mandiana-Yanfolila, Madina and Farako Faults (Figure 4.13)    The Yanfolila belt is the only belt that can be confirmed with Figure 4.14.   The folds were all confirmed in the potassium map (Figure 4.14).   The shear zones were all confirmed apart from Siguiri and Kadiolo Shears Zone. || An  east-west  trending dolerite dyke is clearly evident in the inversion model and corresponds with dyke 1 marked  in  Figure  4.13;  the  dyke  crosscuts  the  Yanfolila  fault  and  Yanfolila  belt. East-west  trending  linear  intrusions have been mapped as dolerite dykes across the study are a (Reference)  According to the gravity data inversion, high density rocks are located in the northwest of zone 3  (Figure 5.14). The high density coincides with a north-northeast trending susceptibility volume. The  coincidence may indicate basaltic rocks. Geometric elements such as dip, depth of structures and rocks volumes were determined for the  magmatic  and  gravity  inversion  sections  of  zone  3  (Figures  5.13-5.14). The  Yanfolila  fault  dips  steeply west. || Application of vertical integral on the analytical signal  The image presented in Figure 4.8 is the application of vertical integral on the analytical signal  map. The attributes extracted from Figure 4.8 coincide with those extracted from the analytical signal  map in Figure 4.7 but were more enhanced. The Figure 4.8 enabled the identification of:    NE, north and NNW trending lineaments that made up the Yanfolila belt. These lineaments  could be the lithological trends of Yanfolila belt.   The Bougouni belt presents a NW trend with magmatic intrusion around.   The Kolondieba belt (Randgold, 2007). || In  this  research  forward  modelling  included  three  west-east  transects  that  crosscut  first-order  structures  and  greenstone  belts  in  the  study  area. The  forward  models  were  constructed  using  available  geological  fact  and  petrophysical  data. The  correspondence  between  observed  and  calculated data was performed iteratively. The forward modelling aided in the construction of models  from which the geometry of structures was calculated. Transect lines selected included:     Transect 1 (AA’) from GPS coordinates 570950E and 1245150N to 616000E and 1245150N,  and  measures  approximately  45km  in  length. It  transects  the  Yanfolila  belt,  Yanfolila  shear  zone, Madiana-Yanfolila fault, and the Kalana-Kodieran fold in the west central region of the  study area (Figure 4.13). || Syama belt at Syama can be divided into sedimentary sequences of the Tarkwa Group in the east, and  volcano-sedimentary  rocks  of  the  Birimian  Supergroup  to  the  west  (Girard  et  al.,  1998). The  NNE  trending Syama Shear Zone crosscuts the Syama belt (Standing, 2006). The structures that predominate in the study area include first-order scale crustal shear zones, and  second-order shears, faults and folds. The Siguiri basin is dominated by north to NNE trending dextral  strike-slip shear zones (Steyn, 2012), and a second order scale WNW trending faults. The Yanfolila  belt is dominated by the northerly trending Yanfolila Shear Zone (Feybesse et al., 2006a; Randgold,  2008; Miller et al., 2013). The eastern margin of the Bougouni basin is bounded by the Banifing Shear  Zone. || The  inversion  section  of  gravity  data  presented in Figure 5.11 resolves high densities rock volumes at depth in the region of the Yanfolila  shear zone, but these are (apparently) not crosscut by the shear. The high density rocks could be due  to  intrusion  at  depth  that  is  younger  than  the  Yanfolila  shear  zone.

The inversions modelling resolved the geometry of the  shear zone geometries using the surface petrophysical and fact data available. The inversion showed:-   1. There is a difference in thicknesses of sedimentary cover at approximately 1200m for the  Yanfolila shear zone and approximately 700m for Banifing shear zone. 2.

The  forward  models  were  constructed  using  available  geological  fact  and  petrophysical  data. The  correspondence  between  observed  and  calculated data was performed iteratively. The forward modelling aided in the construction of models  from which the geometry of structures was calculated. Transect lines selected included:     Transect 1 (AA’) from GPS coordinates 570950E and 1245150N to 616000E and 1245150N,  and  measures  approximately  45km  in  length. It  transects  the  Yanfolila  belt,  Yanfolila  shear  zone, Madiana-Yanfolila fault, and the Kalana-Kodieran fold in the west central region of the  study area (Figure 4.13). || Secondary  southwest  trending  splay  shears  dip  subvertical  to  steeply  west. The  shears  bound  high  susceptibility  rock  volumes,  and  in  the  centre  of  the  inversion  form  a  left-handed  (anticlockwise)  sigmoid that is consistent with sinistral displacement in the plane of the Yanfolila shear zone (Figure  5.6). 5.3.2.

Zone  2  includes the Yanfolila shear zone; Kalana-Kodiaran fold and Madiana-Yanfolila fault. According to  the petrophysical data, Zone 2 is composed of granite, sedimentary rocks, pegmatite and weathered  granite. || The  basin  is  bordered  by  the  Yanfolila  granites  in  Mali (Figure 2.3). The  Yanfolila  belt  is  the  northwest-trending  extension  in  Mali  of  the  Ziemougoula  volcano- sedimentary belt in Guinea and the Ivory Coast (Figure 2.2). The Yanfolila belt and several outliers  are composed of massive mafic volcanic rock (Girard et al., 1998; Parker and Wilkinson, 2011). The  Yanfolila  belt  is  crosscut  by  the  northerly  trending  Yanfolila  shear  zone  in  Figure  2.2  (Randgold,  2008) which separates the Siguiri basin from the Bougouni Basin. The  Bougouni  basin  (locally  called  the  Bougouni-Kerekoro  basin)  is  situated  between  the  Yanfolila  and  Banifing  shear  zones  (Figure  2.2  and  2.3).

Inverse modelling  The  inversion  was  performed  on  six  (6)  key  zones  according  to  high  levels  of  confidence  established in Table 4.1, and available fact and petrophysical data (Figure 4.17). The location of the  key  zones  is  presented  in  Figure  ***  and  are  situated  on  the  first-order  crustal  scale  Yanfolila  and  Banifing  shear  zones,  and  certain  second-order  structures  and  dykes  (Figure  5.6). The  selection  of  second-order  structures  was  based  on  proximity  to  the  first-order  crustal  scale  structures. The  inversions were performed using magnetic and gravity data in addition to the forward modelling of  transects to produce a consistence model of the selected zone. || Zone 2 is characterised by low magnetic susceptibility (Figure 4.13). The inversion of magnetic and gravity data resolves rock volumes and structures that trend north- northeast (Figure 5.9). According to the gravity data inversion, high density rock volumes are located  in  the  western  region  of  the  inversion  adjacent  to  the  Yanfolila  shear  zone  (Figure  5.9). High  susceptibility rock volumes generally trend north-northeast across zone 2 and are bounded by shears. Geometric elements such as dip, depth of structures and width were determined for the magmatic  and gravity inversion sections of zone 2 (Figures 5.10-5.11). The majority of high susceptibility rocks  dip  steeply  to  the  east,  as  do  their  bounding  shear  zones. || splay shears to the main Yanfolila shear zone. The Yanfolila shear zone crosscuts the Yanfolila belt  according to the similarity of bodies 1 and 6. The Kalana-Kodieran fold also is identified in transect 1. 2. Transect  2  and  3  is  located  to  the  Banifing  shear  zone  which  is  also  a  complex  structure  composed of several shear trends and secondary splay shears. The  forward  modelling of three profiles  across the Yanfolila  and Banifing shear  zones (Figure  4.13) facilitated the characterization and geometry of the first-order structures, in terms of trend and  dip.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Yanfolila, Yanfolila Cercle, Sikasso Region, Mali<br><b>Pages:</b> 16,38,39,40,41,44<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

It was possible to resolve lithology and structures. The  study  in  the  Gawler  craton  in  Australia  by  Stewart  and  Betts  (2010)  was  based  on  the  analysis  of  shear  zones  with  interpretation  of  the  geophysical  data  by  direct  modelling. Geological  data was used as a constraint in building the forward model. The results of this study demonstrated  that  interpretations  by  forward  modelling,  across  large  regions  with  little  or  absent  outcrop,  can  be  extremely useful when building tectonic models. In  a  similar  way,  this  study  will use  large-scale geophysical  airborne data  for interpretation by  modelling  of  southern  Mali  into  northeast  Guinea,  as  a  case  study  region,  where  there  is  currently  limited geological data. || 2.3. Architecture and geological setting of southern Mali and northeast Guinea  The  study  area  in  southern  Mali  and  northeast  Guinea  is  composed  of  metamorphosed  sedimentary units including greywacke, siltstone and conglomerate that are intercalated with volcanic  rocks (Liégeois et al., 1991). The rocks of the study area are grouped from west to east into the Siguiri, Bougouni, and Bagoé  basins,  which  are  divided  by  greenstone  belts  including  the  Yanfolila,  Massigui  and  Syama  belts  (Figure  2.2). They  are  unconformably  overlain  by  the  Neoproterozoic  sediments  of  the  Taoudeni  basin. The Siguiri basin is dominated by the Siguiri-Kankan Formation in Guinea, and is composed of  siltstone,  mudstone  and  subordinate  arkoses,  with pelitic  schist (Egal  et al., 1999;  Lahondère  et  al.,  1999). These sediments are intercalated with pyroclastites or tuffs that are composed of rhyolite and  quartz  lithic  fragments  (Lahondère  et  al.,  2002).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Guinea<br><b>Pages:</b> 16,17<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Location and Physiography  The study area covers the south of Mali and the northeast of Guinea in West Africa (Figure 1.1). Geologically  the  study  area  is  hosted  in  the  Palaeoproterozoic  Baoulé-Mossi  domain  of  the  West  African craton (Figure 1.2). The study area is bounded by 10° 13'N to 12° 47'N latitude, and 9° 60'W to 5° 55'W longitude. It  covers an area of 114,750 km2 mostly across the province of Sikasso in Mali and Sirgui in Guinea. || In Guinea it included geological maps of the Sirakoro (Egal et al., 1999a; Costea et  al.,  1999),  Siguiri  (Egal  et  al.,  1999b),  Kankan  (Feybesse  et  al.,  1999),  Falama  (Lahondère  et  al.,  1999a;  Iliescu  et  al.,  1999)  and  Faraba  sheets  (Lahondère  et  al.,  1999b)  (Figure  1.3). There  are  no  geology technical reports available at the regional scale for Guinea. In Mali, maps include the Kadiolo  or  Niellé  (Kusnir  et  al.,  1986)  Massigui  (Claessens  et  al.,  1988)  and  Kadiana  or  Tingrela  sheets  (Kusnir  et  al.,  1989),  and  additionally  the  Yanfolila,  Tienko,  Bougouni,  Massigui,  Tingréla,  Nielle,  Bamako East and Bamako West sheets of Feybesse et al. (2006) (Figure 1.3) The reports include the  geological map of Mali by  Girard et al. (1998), the geophysical data interpretation of southern Mali  by  Randgold  (2007,  2008),  a  technical  report  by  Parker  and  Wilkinson  (2011)  and  finally,  a  geological  map  produced  by  Miller  et  al.

Also  most  geological  structures  are  not  detectable  by  only  one  geophysical  method,  which  therefore  requires  a  combination  of  several  geophysical  methods  to  constrain  structures  and  geological  domains. The  combination  of  geophysical  methods  is  an  optimization  that  supports  the  geophysical interpretation and contributes in determining the geological elements that are important in  developing an understanding of the subsurface geology. The limitation in optimisation is the cost of  applying multiple geophysical techniques and methods. With this in mind, this project aims to use a combination of geophysical methods for modelling  by integrating the available geological data to build a 3D geophysical model of the study area, and to  interpret  geological  structures  and  geological  domains. Specifically,  the  aims  are  to  (1)  establish  tectonic domains in the south of Mali and northeast of Guinea; (2) to determine if structures (shears,  faults, etc.) beneath the thin sedimentary cover (up to 100m) potential to host structurally-hosted gold  mineralization  for  known  gold  deposit;  and  (3)  constrain  a  strato-tectonic  history  for  the  region  of  study  from  extracted  geophysical  attributes.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Guinea<br><b>Pages:</b> 19,9<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
