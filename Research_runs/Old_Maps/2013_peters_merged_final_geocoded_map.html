The  coherent  and  autoclastic  units  of  the  study  area  formed  as  a  result  of  effusive  eruptions. Effusive eruptions are typical of basaltic liquids, particularly when submerged beneath the confining  water column. Effusive eruptions are characterized by the ability of lava to flow (low viscosity) rather  than explode (Parfitt and Wilson, 2008) because volatiles escape passively through vesicle formation  (McPhie et al., 1993; Bardintzeff and McBirney, 2000; Parfitt and Wilson, 2008). The  coherent  and  autoclastic  facies  are  interpreted  to  have  formed  proximally  to  the  volcanic  source. However, because basaltic lavas have low viscosities, they are able to flow laterally between  tens and hundreds of metres before solidification.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Bouroum, Mirriah, Zinder Region, Niger<br><b>Pages:</b> 74<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

It  was  suggested  that  an  intermediate  geochemistry  between  back-arc  basins  and  island-arc  tholeiites  made  such  an  environment an attractive setting, especially due to regionally low Nb concentrations (Zonou, 1987),  but  the  lack  of  ultramafic  rocks  (Burke,  1988)  and  unfitting  isotopic  and  trace  element  signatures  indicated an oceanic plateau origin (Abouchami et al., 1990). The distinction between the GB basalt samples forming in an arc-related basin compared to an  oceanic plateau setting is in their strato-tectonic context. The tholeiitic basalts from the GB have many  similarities to the general tholeiitic compositions from around the craton.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Burke County, North Carolina, United States<br><b>Pages:</b> 81<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

For  example,  the  greenschist  facies  Mt  Reid  volcanics  of  western  Tasmania  yield  fairly  well  preserved volcanic textures where the rocks are not strongly altered by hydrothermal processes and/or  deformed  (McPhie  and  Allen,  2003). An  example  of  this  is  the  devitrification  of  volcanic  glass,  as  described  by  McPhie  and  Allen  (op  cit.,  2003);  crystal  boundaries  remain  intact  and  the  glass  recrystallises as zeolites with a minor proportion of clay minerals. As a further example, metamorphosed Triassic basalt lavas in NW Croatia were interpreted as  proximal  to intermediate  facies  by  Palinkaš  et  al. (2008)  based  on  volcanic textures  such  as  closely  packed  pillows,  hyaloclastite,  pepperite  and  tortoise-shell  jointing.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Croatia<br><b>Pages:</b> 30<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  volcanic  rocks  are  made  up  of  an  intercalated  sequence  of  hyaloclastic  basalt,  pillowed basalt, massive-variolitic basalt, andesite and dacite. The upper section of the stratigraphy is  made up of a second volcano-sedimentary succession containing siltstone-shale beds, pebble-boulder  conglomerates, greywacke-turbidite, felsic pyroclastic deposits, with thin  intercalations of basalt and  andesite (Figure 2.1). Immediately west of the GB, volcanic, pyroclastic and sedimentary sequences are intruded by  several tonalite and granodiorite plutons, and a megacrystic granite, as well as a number of greenschist  facies meta-gabbro and meta-diorite intrusions. The Loudo and Pissila batholith crops out east of the  GB. The Pissila  batholith is made up of biotite and hornblende granodiorites (Figure 2.1.)

P exhibits a large, negative anomaly (~twice the size of Ti)  with values ranging from ~0.03-0.5 that of chondrite. || On  the x-axis, between Hf and Gd, there is no relative enrichment or depletion. Toward the HFS elements,  the Boromo-Houndé samples exhibit slight depletions relative to the GB tholeiitic basalts. Overall, the  calc-alkaline rocks  from  the  Boromo-Houndé  belts  report  a  decreasing  trend  from  Rb  toward  Lu. A  negative  Ti  anomaly  is  again  evident  in  all  samples.

Rb  also  shows  low  values,  particularly  for  the  GB  and  Boromo-Houndé  samples. The Tiebélé basalt samples show low Rb values, but not as low as the other two sample regions. It is  unlikely that the negative Rb values are caused by distortion, as a result of its position on the x-axis  because it was plotted adjacent to Ba, which contains similar ionic properties. Thus Rb is probably low  due its mobility during alteration. || TiO2 will  crystallise  and  form  oxide  minerals  such  as  rutile  and  ilmenite  (g)  The  MgO-Na2O  plot  displayed  the  Na2O  concentration  increasing  slowly  as  MgO  concentration  remained high. As  the MgO concentration began to decrease, the Na2O concentration rapidly increased. This can  be explained by the crystallization of the Na-rich end-members of plagioclase, towards the end  of crystallization (h) The MgO-P2O5 plot also resolved an increasing trend as MgO decreased,  suggesting  phosphorus  did  not  crystallise  (i)  The  MgO-FeO  plot  resolved  an  increasing  FeO  trend. It would be expected at some point in the fractionation process for Fe to partition into Fe- oxide  minerals,  explaining  the  decrease  in  FeO  concentrations.

Location and physiography  Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger  and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the  Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average  daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and  northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal  activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993;  Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || Vidal and Alric (1994)  interpreted that the basaltic sequences were the product of back-arc basin volcanism. Pouclet et al. (1996) and Hirdes et al. (1996) described two major periods of volcanism for the  WAC from two discrete but juxtaposed volcano-(sedimentary) belts in northeast Cote d’Ivoire;   (1)  an  eastern  belt  is  composed  of  basaltic  and  pyroclastic-dominated  volcanic  rocks  that  were  emplaced  at  approximately  2185-2150  Ma  (U-Pb  zircon). The  volcanic  rocks  are  widespread  in  Ghana, eastern Cote d’Ivoire and eastern Burkina Faso (WAXI, 2013). 16 || LIST OF FIGURES  Figure  1.1.

Evidence is based on  a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style  basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and  trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the  occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised  concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as  well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic  of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits,  siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed  of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Figure  1.1.

Specific focus is given to the volcanic rocks of Burkina Faso. (2) Chapter Three provides a detailed description of the methodologies used in this thesis. || Figure  2.1.

The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the  Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The  Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt.

Northwest and northeast trending  shears  and  thrusts  are  represented  as  well  as  WNW  trending  shears  of  the  Wabo-Tampelse  Event. || The volcanic facies were  established through field and petrographic interpretations. The subaqueous facies architecture consists  of proximal, coherent and autoclastic basaltic flow units containing porphyritic, aphyric, amygdaloidal  and hyaloclastic textures as well as pillowed, jointed and flow-banded basaltic lithofacies. Proximal to  distal volcanogenic manganese deposits intercalated with basalt flows indicate a syn-volcanic genesis. A  discrete  pyroclastic  interbed  (~300  m  thick)  within  a  volcanogenic,  marginal  marine  to  offshore  greywacke succession occupies a distal facies relative to the volcanic source and indicates a bimodal  source of volcanism, i.e., mafic and intermediate. Volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  are  characterized  by  quartz-ankerite  stockwork  breccia,  a  braunite-ilmenite-magnetite-chalcopyrite-pyrite-(gold)  mineral  assemblage  and  increased  Ba  concentrations,  indicating  syn-volcanic  seafloor-related  hydrothermal  activity. The  Goren  volcano- sedimentary  belt  presents potential for  economic  mineralisation  in  volcanogenic  primary  manganese  and base metal deposits. || Two seasons are predominant in Burkina Faso, namely  the wet and dry seasons. The dry season occurs from October to May, which is followed by the wet  season from June until September (Bierschenk, 1968; McFarland et al., 1998). Geographically,  the  capital  city  of  Ouagadougou  is  situated  at  the  centre  of  the  country. The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  is  located  in  the  Sanmatenga  district. The  belt  is  elongate  and  northwest-trending and extends from the towns of Kaya to Kongossi (Figure 1.1). The town of Kaya is  approximately 90 km northeast of Ouagadougou and lies at the southeastern end of the belt. || volcanic  VHMS  deposit  of  the  Tiebélé  Dome  in  the  south  of  Burkina  Faso  is  a  sphalerite  bearing,  zinc-rich exhalative deposit (Ilboudo, 2010). 2.5. The Goren volcano-sedimentary belt  The  Goren  volcano-sedimentary  belt  was  deposited  approximately  2400-2300  Ma  and  is  characterized  by  a  conformable  sequence  of  sedimentary  rocks,  interbedded  with  volcaniclastic  and  pyroclastic deposits. Intercalated with this succession are mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks (Hein et  al., 2004; Hein, 2010). The belt has subsequently been subjected to three deformation events as well as  intruded  by  various  intrusive  bodies  and is  metamorphosed to  sub-greenschist to  middle  greenschist  facies (Hein et al., 2004; Kříbek et al., 2008).

It was suggested by Pearce (1996) that back-arc and/or intra-arc basin basalts  should be referred to as transitional between back-arc basin basalts and intra-arc tholeiites (IAT) when  geochemical  evidence  cannot  ascertain  the  correct  tectonic  setting.

For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano- sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with  Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were  leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and  concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative  processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the  same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be  juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology,  sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic  environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1)  where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are  intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe   bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Rue Ilboudo Julien, 220 logements, Adjamé, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire<br><b>Pages:</b> 18<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano- sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with  Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were  leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and  concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative  processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the  same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be  juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology,  sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic  environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1)  where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are  intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe   bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Lajoie, Fabas, Saint-Gaudens, Haute-Garonne, Occitania, Metropolitan France, 31230, France<br><b>Pages:</b> 18<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

ROCK TYPES OF THE GOREN BELT  4.1. Introduction  The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are  intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia. These rocks were intruded  by  TTG  suite  plutons  including  the  Pissila  Batholith  and  the  Loudo  granodiorite  (Figure  2.1),  and  pyroxenite,  dolerite  and  aplite  dykes. The  basalt,  sedimentary  rocks  and  pyroclastic  breccias  are  metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  (Kříbek  et  al.,  2008),  or  middle  greenschist  facies  (Hein  et  al.,  2004), with amphibolite facies adjacent to plutons and dykes. This research was focused in areas of the  southern GB, where primary volcanic and sedimentary textures were only affected by sub-greenschist  and lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism. || A variety of granodiorite intrusions are shown including the Pissila batholith and Loudo  granodiorite that crop out to the east of the Goren belt.

For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano- sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with  Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were  leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and  concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative  processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the  same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be  juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology,  sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic  environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1)  where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are  intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe   bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Stix, East 23rd Street, Rose Hill, Manhattan Community Board 5, Manhattan, New York County, New York, 10010, United States<br><b>Pages:</b> 18<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

(1994)  for  Archaean  basalts  from  the  Yilgarn  and  Superior  Cratons. They  calculated  partition  coefficients  for  phosphorus  and  reported  that  phosphorus  is  more  likely  to  substitute  for  silica  in  garnet,  clinopyroxene  and  Ca-perovskite,  and  determined  that  phosphorus  partitioned  into  Ca- perovskite  >  majorite  garnet  >  pyrope  garnet  >  clinopyroxene  with  negligible  amounts  partitioning  into olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel. In attempt to quantify the likelihood of phosphorus retention in the magma source in general for  GB samples, a simple calculation was done (Appendix C) to determine how much  phosphorus could  be retained in garnet and clinopyroxene in ancient magmas. The assumption was made that 0.05 wt%  P2O5 was present in these magmas and 15 % partial melting occurred. The primitive mantle value for  phosphorus was taken from Anders and Grevesse (1989).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Superior, Douglas County, Wisconsin, 54880, United States<br><b>Pages:</b> 78<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Metallogenesis  Metallogenesis in the northeast of Burkina Faso includes gold, diamonds,  Mn-Fe, silver, lead,  molybdenum,  copper  and  zinc  (Hastings,  1982;  Milési  et  al.,  1989,  1992;  Hein  et  al.,  2004;  Tshibubudze  et  al.,  2009). In  the  Oudalan-Gorouol  belt,  manganese  deposits  occur  at  Tambão  and  Billiata  (Figure  1.1)  and  Fe-Ti-V  mineralization  occurs  in  the  Tin  Edia  deposit. Gold  occurrences  include  commercially  mined  goldfields  such  as  Essakane,  Inata  and  Taparko  goldfields,  as  well  as  artisanally mined deposits such as Falagountou artisanal mine.

Diamondiferous lamproite and lamprophyre plugs and dykes crop out NNW of Kaya  in the Pissila batholith in the Barsalogo diamond field, with rare kimberlite pipes (WAXI, 2013). || A  correlation  between  increased  Ba  and  base  metals  also  suggests  seafloor  hydrothermal  activity in a proximal setting to a volcanic source (c.f., Burnham, 1962; Lydon, 1988; Ҫaǧatay 1993;  Herrington  et  al.,  2005). For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || The Essakane, Falagountou, Taparko and Inata goldfields are represented in north-northeast of  Burkina Faso. The Billiata and Tambão Mn deposits and the Tin Edia Mn-Fe-V deposit are located on the western margin of  the Oudalan-Gorouol belt. The Barsalogo diamond fields are located north of the Goren belt. 17<br><b>Geocode:</b> Tambao, Markoye, Oudalan, Sahel, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 17,24,76<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The samples range from 45.5 to 55.9 SiO2 (wt%) with  the lowest  SiO2  concentration  sampled  from  the  Tiebélé region  and  the  highest from  the  GB. Some  samples  from  Tiebélé  and Boromo-Houndé  belts  show  higher  Na2O+K2O  (wt%)  when  compared  to  the GB volcanics. The OGB samples show a relatively large difference in SiO2. Sample BF_1366, in  particular reported little Na2O+K2O (~ 0.2 wt %). The Boromo-Houndé volcanics plot on a trend from  basalt to andesite as the SiO2 and Na2O+K2O increased. || A  trend  from  MgO  toward FeOtotal was resolved for the Boromo-Houndé tholeiitic basalts, which plot in the tholeiite field. The  Tiebélé  samples  did  not  resolve  a  trend  possibly  due  to  the  limited  sample  suite  analysed  by  Ilboudo (2010). They were scattered throughout the calc-alkaline and tholeiitic fields. Harker  diagrams  were  plotted  for  samples  from  the  GB. They  are  summarized  according  to  trends  observed. MgO  was  used  on  the  x-axis  rather  than  SiO2  because  the  range  of  MgO  in  mafic  volcanic  rocks  is  much  less  than  SiO2,  avoiding  the  effect  of  distortion. || Another  possibility  for  such  anomalous  phosphorus  could  be  due  to  carbonate  alteration. Phosphate  bearing  minerals  such  as  apatite  do dissolve  readily  in  acidic fluids,  even with relatively weak acidity (Prof. G. Cawthorn, Pers. Comm.). The comparison between the tholeiitic basalts from the southern GB with those from the Tiebélé  and  Boromo-Houndé  belts,  and  calc-alkaline  mafic-intermediate  rocks  of  the  Boromo-Houndé  belts  78 || Less  than  half  of  the  Tiebélé  basalts  plot in  the  Low-K  field,  while  the  rest  plot  within  the  Medium-K  and  Shoshonite  series. This  indicates  both  tholeiitic  and  calc-alkaline  compositions for all the samples plotted. The  samples  from  the  GB  were  plotted  on  an  AFM  diagram. AFM  diagrams  can  have  their  limitations, including their petrogenetic information. This is due to the components that make up the  trivariate diagram that collectively make up less than half of the potential chemical constituents of a  rock. In  addition,  because  data  are  normalised  to  100  %  in  order  to  plot  on  a  ternary  diagram,  distortions can occur to a certain degree (Rollinson, 1993). || Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts plot within  the Low-K series as well as the calc-alkaline fields (Medium-K, High-K series and the Shoshonite series. The Tiebélé samples  vary between the different fields. (e) The AFM diagram plots samples from various locations. The GB volcanic rocks plot in  the tholeiitic phase whereas the Boromo-Houndé samples are split between tholeiitic and calc-alkaline compositions which  agrees with classifications made by Baratoux et al. (2011). The Tiebélé samples are also distributed between calc-alkaline  and tholeiitic compositions. || Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts plot within the Low-K series as well as the  calc-alkaline fields (Medium-K, High-K series and the Shoshonite series.

(2011). The Tiebélé  samples  are also  distributed  between calc-alkaline  and  tholeiitic compositions. || The  average range in concentrations for LREE is from ~8-25 times the chondritic value, whereas the  HREE range between ~9 and 20 times chondrite. Some samples present slight depletions, while  others present slight enrichments from LREE to HREE. (b) Chondrite-normalised REE diagram  comparing  the  GB,  Boromo-Houndé  and  Tiebélé  tholeiitic  basalts. The  REE  patterns  of  each  sample  suite  present  parallel  patterns  of  similar  magnitudes. The  Tiebélé  samples  present  a  slightly  decreasing  trend  from  LREE  to  HREE. (c)  Chondrite-normalised  REE  diagram  comparing tholeiitic basalts from the GB to the Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline volcanic rocks. || The  GB  rocks  plot  within the basalt, basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. Samples from the Boromo-Houndé belts  are distributed throughout the basalt, basaltic-andesite and andesite fields. The Tiebélé samples  have a smaller SiO2 range but some samples contain increased alkali concentrations and plot as  trachyandesite and tephrite. The Oudalan-Gorouol belt samples plot between basalt and basaltic- andesite. (d)  SiO2  versus K2O  (wt%) demonstrates  that the  GB  volcanic rocks  plot  within the  Low-K series for the most part. One sample plots in the Medium-K series with a K2O value of  ~1 wt%. || The  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  (Figure  6.6a)  show  an  overall  flat  trend,  although  samples  are  slightly  enriched,  or  slightly  depleted  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE. Small  negative  Eu  anomalies  as  well  as  positive  and  negative  Ce  anomalies  were  observed  in  some  samples. When  comparing  the  Tiebélé  basalts  to  the  GB  tholeiitic  basalts  (Figure  6.6b),  the  LREE  are  slightly  enriched relative to the HREE. The majority of the Tiebélé basalts exhibit REE concentrations more  than 10 times that of chondrite. Both negative and positive Eu anomalies occurr in the Tiebélé basalts,  which  contrasts  with  the  GB  tholeiitic  basalts. The  positive  anomalies  suggest  that  plagioclase  accumulated from the melt in high enough abundance to allow for positive Eu concentrations. || The Boromo-Houndé and Tiebélé basaltic rocks were also plotted in  Figure 6.1d. The highest  silica  content  for  all  the  samples  was  less  than  65  wt%  SiO2. The  maximum  K2O  value  was  approximately 4.5 wt%. Half of the Boromo-Houndé samples plot in the Low-K series together with  the  GB  samples. The  remaining  samples,  originally  defined  as  calc-alkaline  basalt  and  andesite  by  Baratoux  et  al. (2011),  plot  in  the  calc-alkaline  fields,  including  the  Medium-K,  High-K  and  Shoshonitic  fields. || The GB rocks plot within the basalt,  basaltic-andesite and andesite fields.

The  calc-alkaline  rocks  present  enrichment  in  LREE  relative  to  HREE  compared  to  the  tholeiitic  compositions,  resulting  in  a  decreasing  trend. Boromo-Houndé calc-alkaline volcanic rocks have La values range from ~30-80 time chondrite and Lu between ~6 and 12  times chondrite. Negative Eu anomalies are present. || The Tiebélé samples (HTPILL and HTBA),  which had been classified as basaltic rocks by Ilboudo (2010),show high Na2O+K2O values (up to ~6  and  10  wt%)  and  plot  as  tephrite/basanite  and  trachyandesite,  respectively. Sample  HTGOGO  from  the Tiebélé region, plots as an alkaline volcanic rock in the basalt field. The highest K2O+Na2O value  from  the  Tiebélé  samples  is  9.86  wt%. The  GB  samples  show  a  maximum  K2O+Na2O  value  of  4.7  wt%. A  further  sub-division  of sub-alkalic  rocks  is  shown using  SiO2  versus K2O  in wt% in  Figure  6.1d. Le Maitre et al. || This indicates comparable trace element behaviour. A negative Ti anomaly was observed  for  every  sample. Rb  also  shows  low  values,  particularly  for  the  GB  and  Boromo-Houndé  samples. The Tiebélé basalt samples show low Rb values, but not as low as the other two sample regions. It is  unlikely that the negative Rb values are caused by distortion, as a result of its position on the x-axis  because it was plotted adjacent to Ba, which contains similar ionic properties. Thus Rb is probably low  due its mobility during alteration.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Tiébélé, Nahouri, Central-South, Burkina Faso<br><b>Pages:</b> 11,13,55,57,58,59,66,67,78<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005). || A  variety  of  geochemical  methods  was  used  in  attempt  to  classify the samples in order to characterize the tectonic setting for volcanic rocks of the GB.

These  overprinting  textures  resemble  typical  supergene  alteration  found  in  the  Kuruman  manganese  deposits  in  the  Transvaal  Supergroup  of  South  Africa  (Beyeme  Zogo,  2010),  suggesting  that  the  volcanogenic  system  underwent  supergene  alteration  at  some stage. The  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  of  the  GB  resemble  the  Cyprus-type  volcanogenic  manganese deposits defined by Mosier and Page (1988). Cyprus-type deposits occur as lenticular units  bounded  between  volcanic  and  volcaniclastic  rocks,  and  can  be  proximal  to  distal  to  the  volcanic  source. It is probably the case for the GB that the Mn-Fe-rich, carbonaceous sedimentary rocks formed  as  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits  in  a  proximal  to  distal  volcanic  setting. A  distal  setting  is  indicated  by  low  Ba  concentrations,  fine-laminations  with  thin  ferruginous  chert,  and  dolomite  interbeds, while a proximal setting is indicated because some Mn-Fe-rich units present an increase in  oxides and Ba concentrations and increased base metal values.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Transvaal, Wittingen, Gifhorn, Lower Saxony, 29379, Germany<br><b>Pages:</b> 75<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

Despite  these  investigations,  surprisingly  little  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  volcanic  sequences  at  the  scale  of  one  or  several  belts  in  West  Africa. Few  studies  have  been  conducted  on  volcanic facies and metal potential in terms of base metals and Mn mineralisation, but delineating the  volcanic facies and alteration zones  of volcanic belts can help in identifying and targeting volcanic- related mineral deposits. For example, the Mount Reid volcanics in western Tasmania and the Abitibi  greenstone  belt  of  central  Canada  are  both  regions  where  volcanogenic  massive  sulphide  mineralization  has  been  found. Their  volcanic  facies  and  alteration  zones  are  well  understood,  providing spatial constraints to economic mineralization (McPhie et al., 1993; Piché and Jébrak 2006). Delineating facies is also important in developing tectonic models for volcanic terranes. || 1.2. Location and physiography  Burkina  Faso  is  situated in  West  Africa  and is  bordered  by  Ghana,  Benin, Togo,  Mali,  Niger  and Côte d’Ivoire. It is a landlocked country that covers an area of 274 300 km2. It lies mostly in the  Sahel climatic zone. The  Sahelian  zone  is  characterized  by  hot  and  arid  conditions. Burkina  Faso  has  an  average  daily temperature of 32° C and less than 25 cm of rainfall annually, particularly in the northern and  northeastern regions (McFarland et al., 1998). || 1.4.

TTG  and  diorite  emplacement  at  2200  Ma  and  2160-2130  Ma  preceded  the  Eburnean Orogeny, while granite-leucogranite emplacement at 2100-2070 Ma was concurrent with the  Eburnean  Orogeny  (Leube  et  al.,  1990;  Cheilletz  et  al.,  1994;  Pons  et  al.,  1995;  Hirdes  and  Davis,  2002;  Pawlig  et al.,  2006; Gueye  et  al., 2008;  WAXI,  2013). The  presence  of TTG  suite  plutons  in  West  Africa  is  interpreted  as  (indirect)  evidence  for  subduction  in  the  Precambrian  (Martin,  1994;  Martin et al., 2005) because TTG have some similarities to modern slab melts and arc magmatic rocks. (Drummond and Defant, 1990). In Burkina Faso, two granitoid emplacement events are recognized (Castaing et al., 2003; Naba  et al., 2004): (1) a suite of granodiorite, tonalite and diorite plutons intruded the Birimian Supergroup  (2210-2160 Ma), and (2) a granite suite intruded the Birimian  Supergroup and TTG suite granitoids  (2150-2130 Ma) (Castaing et al., 2003). A suite of granodiorite and granite plutons (2255-2253 Ma) in  the Oudalan-Gorouol belt (OGB) of northeast Burkina Faso may represent basement to the Birimian  Supergroup in the WAC (Tshibubudze et al., 2013). || Most importantly, I wish to thank WAXI (West African Exploration Initiative), the AMIRA and  its sponsors, without whom this research would not have been possible. I  wish  to  gratefully  acknowledge  AMIRA  International  and  the  industry  sponsors,  including  AusAid and the ARC Linkage Project LP110100667, for their support of the WAXI Project (P934A). I am also appreciative of the contribution of the various Geological Surveys/Department of Mines in  West Africa as sponsors in-kind of WAXI.

ROCK TYPES OF THE GOREN BELT  4.1. Introduction  The  rock  types  of  the  southern  Goren  Belt  (GB)  consist  primarily  of  basalt  units  that  are  intercalated with a succession of sedimentary rocks and pyroclastic breccia. These rocks were intruded  by  TTG  suite  plutons  including  the  Pissila  Batholith  and  the  Loudo  granodiorite  (Figure  2.1),  and  pyroxenite,  dolerite  and  aplite  dykes. The  basalt,  sedimentary  rocks  and  pyroclastic  breccias  are  metamorphosed  to  sub-greenschist  (Kříbek  et  al.,  2008),  or  middle  greenschist  facies  (Hein  et  al.,  2004), with amphibolite facies adjacent to plutons and dykes. This research was focused in areas of the  southern GB, where primary volcanic and sedimentary textures were only affected by sub-greenschist  and lower-middle greenschist facies metamorphism. || Another  possibility  for  such  anomalous  phosphorus  could  be  due  to  carbonate  alteration. Phosphate  bearing  minerals  such  as  apatite  do dissolve  readily  in  acidic fluids,  even with relatively weak acidity (Prof. G. Cawthorn, Pers. Comm.).

Hyaloclastic basalt breccias crop out throughout the southern GB as discrete units and as inter- pillow  detritus  in  pillowed  basalt  units. Commonly  pillow  basalt  grades  into  hyaloclastite  breccia  units. Breccia  fragments  are  surrounded  by  a  fine  crystalline  matrix  and/or  altered  volcanic  glass. || They  are  associated  with  low  discharge rates of magma and/or extrusion onto low gradient slopes (Griffiths and Fink, 1992). Pillow  lavas of the southern GB are interpreted to have formed in relatively shallow water, due to their high  vesicle abundance, and perhaps only a few hundred meters water depth (cf. Jones, 1969). The vesicles  indicate  movement  of  gas  toward  flow  boundaries,  particularly  the  top  of  flow  units;  for  example,  Archaean subaqueous basalts in Quebec were identified by Dimroth et al. (1978) with an abundance of  vesicles  positioned  towards  the  upper  margins  of  flow  units  and  less  abundant  in  the  flow/pillow  interior. However, the accumulation of vesicles is not unique to subaqueous flows. || the GB basalts could have extended into an intermediate facies, further away from the volcanic  vent  from which they were erupted. 7.1.2. Sedimentary rocks of the south Goren belt  Conformable  sedimentary  sequences  are  intercalated  with  basalt  flows  in  the  stratigraphic  sequence  of  the  southern  GB. These  include  Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sediments,  siltstone,  volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit. Mn-Fe-rich  carbonaceous  sedimentary  rocks  are  common  in  the  southern  GB  (Section  4.3.5;  Hein  et  al.,  2004)  and,  in  fact,  throughout  the  WAC  (Section  1.1;  Blanchot  et  al.,  1972;  Béssoles,  1977; Wright, 1985; Neumann, 1988; Leube et al., 1990; Melcher, 1995; Kříbek et al., 2008; Beauvais  et al., 2008).

Evidence is based on  a conformable sequence of basalts that have geochemical affinities of normal mid-oceanic ridge style  basalts (N-MORB) as well as arc-related magmas. Tholeiitic compositions, determined by major and  trace element geochemistry, are exclusive to the study area, which is unique to northeast Burkina Faso. Flat,  chondrite-normalised  REE  patterns  suggest  dominantly  N-MORB  compositions,  with  the  occasional  elevated  Th  and  Al2O3  values,  suggestive  of  arc  basalts. Depleted  chondrite-normalised  concentrations  of  phosphorus  (0.5-0.03  times  lower  than  chondrite)  and  Ti  (1-5  times  chondrite)  as  well as anomalous concentrations of N-MORB-normalised Ta (80-120 times greater) are characteristic  of the tholeiitic basalts of the Goren belt. The  volcanic  rocks  are  intercalated  with  a  succession  of  volcanogenic  manganese  deposits,  siltstone, volcaniclastite, volcanogenic greywacke and a discrete pyroclastic breccia deposit composed  of lapilli- to bomb-sized  volcanic debris, indicative of bimodal volcanism. || Distal  versus proximal facies and coherent versus volcaniclastic facies can be interpreted using lithological  relationships, volcanic textures and rock composition. For example, in the Tiebélé Dome in southern  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1),  chert  and  manganese  horizons  act  as  marker  units  in  local  volcano- sedimentary belts (Melcher, 1995; Ilboudo, 2010). The chert and manganese units are intercalated with  Zn-rich  volcanic-hosted  massive  sulphide  (VHMS)  mineralization,  and  manganese  and  silica  were  leached  from  the  volcanic  rocks  during  hydrothermal  activity,  synchronous  to  volcanism,  and  concomitant to precipitation at the water-rock interface (Melcher, 1995), i.e., syn-volcanic exhalative  processes took place during eruption. Volcanic terranes are often complicated because volcanic and sedimentary processes work at the  same time (Cas and Wright, 1987; Lajoie and Stix, 1992) and volcanic and sedimentary rocks may be  juxtaposed  in  a  complicated  manner. However,  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  volcanology,  sedimentology and geochemistry of volcano-sedimentary belts can accurately reconstruct the volcanic  environment. This has been the focus of research in the southern Goren volcano-sedimentary belt (Figure 1.1)  where the stratigraphy is characterised by a conformable sequence of meta-sedimentary rocks that are  intercalated with basalt, andesite, dacite, pyroclastite and volcanic tuff, and carbonaceous and Mn-Fe   bearing shale (Hein et al., 2004; Hein, 2010). || The belt is weakly to moderately metamorphosed, giving  a  unique  opportunity  to study  relatively  pristine  volcanic textures and  establish  volcanic  facies. The  volcano-sedimentary  units  have  been  mapped,  sampled  in  detail  and  analysed  both  petrographically  and  geochemically. From  field  studies,  geological  and  volcanic  facies  maps  were  created. This  information  has  been  used  to  interpret  volcanic  setting. The  metallogenic  potential  of  the  southern  Goren volcano-sedimentary belt has also been assessed in this study. 18<br><b>Geocode:</b> Goren, Maale Yosef Regional Council, Acre Subdistrict, North District, Israel<br><b>Pages:</b> 18,3<br><b>Type:</b> GEOLOGICAL_UNIT<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

The  volcanic  rocks  are  made  up  of  an  intercalated  sequence  of  hyaloclastic  basalt,  pillowed basalt, massive-variolitic basalt, andesite and dacite. The upper section of the stratigraphy is  made up of a second volcano-sedimentary succession containing siltstone-shale beds, pebble-boulder  conglomerates, greywacke-turbidite, felsic pyroclastic deposits, with thin  intercalations of basalt and  andesite (Figure 2.1). Immediately west of the GB, volcanic, pyroclastic and sedimentary sequences are intruded by  several tonalite and granodiorite plutons, and a megacrystic granite, as well as a number of greenschist  facies meta-gabbro and meta-diorite intrusions. The Loudo and Pissila batholith crops out east of the  GB. The Pissila  batholith is made up of biotite and hornblende granodiorites (Figure 2.1.)  (Simoko,  2012;  WAXI,  2013)  and  is  cross-cut  by  tonalite  dykes  and  pegmatite  veins.<br><b>Geocode:</b> Vector GB Ltd., 2480, The Crescent, Birmingham Business Park, Bickenhill and Marston Green, Coleshill Heath, Birmingham, West Midlands, England, B37 7YE, United Kingdom<br><b>Pages:</b> 25<br><b>Type:</b> APPROXIMATE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];

For  the  most  part,  higher  Ba  values  in  the  GB  correlate  with  higher  concentrations  of  Mn,  implying  that  the  manganese  deposits  formed  in  oxidising  conditions  proximally. The manganese mineralization of the GB is similar to primary manganese mineralization seen  throughout  the  WAC  that  is  interpreted  as  volcanogenic  in  character. For  example,  the  VHMS  mineralization in the Tiebélé belt is intercalated with chert and manganese units (Sections 1.1 and 2.4)  in  carbonaceous  manganese  rocks  (Ilboudo,  2010)  and  is  characterized  by  sphalerite-galena- chalcopyrite-pyrite-bornite  assemblages  that  are  volcanogenic. Additionally,  the  manganese- carbonates  of  the  Nsuta  deposit  in  the  Ashanti  Belt  in  Ghana  are  hosted  by  a  volcano-sedimentary  sequence  in  basalt-andesite  units  (Nyame,  2008),  and  indicate  a  volcanic  setting. Furthermore  the  Tambão  (supergene)  deposit  in  Burkina  Faso  (Figure  1.1)  is  sited  above  primary  manganese-rich  carbonate  that  is  hosted  in  volcanic  units  (Colin  et  al.,  2005).<br><b>Geocode:</b> Sagatay Lane, Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation, Kenora District, Northwestern Ontario, Ontario, Canada<br><b>Pages:</b> 76<br><b>Type:</b> PLACE<br><b>Accuracy:</b> exact</div>`)[0];
